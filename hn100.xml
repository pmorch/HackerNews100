<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="story-detail" data-guid="1850112"><p>At least 14 people were killed and dozens injured on Monday as violent protests by youths rocked the Nepalese capital and certain other areas over the government's decision to ban social media sites, prompting authorities to deploy the army in Kathmandu to control the situation.</p><p>Thousands of youths, including school students, under the banner of Gen Z, converged in front of Parliament in the heart of Kathmandu and shouted anti-government slogans demanding immediate revocation of the ban.</p><p>The Nepalese media put the death toll at 14. However, there is no official word on the number of casualties yet.</p><p>The demonstration turned violent when some protesters entered the Parliament complex, prompting police to resort to baton charges, tear gas shells and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd, eyewitnesses said.</p><p>Citing hospital reports, the Himalayan Times newspaper reported that 14 people were killed in the protest in Kathmandu. Six people died at Trauma Centre, three at Civil Hospital, three at Everest Hospital, one at Kathmandu Medical College (KMC), and one at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, the paper said.</p><p>The death toll from the ongoing Gen-Z protests has reached 14, news portal Khabarhub reported, citing sources at the Ministry of Health and Population.</p><p>The Kantipur newspaper, quoting doctors at the hospitals in Kathmandu, also reported that 14 people were killed in the violence.</p><p>A Nepal Police spokesperson said that 42 people, including two security personnel, were injured and are currently undergoing treatment in the Civil Hospital of Kathmandu.</p><p>However, the Himalayan Times newspaper said that the number of injured remains uncertain due to the large volume of cases.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-2503">
	
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>As a bit of background, one of my hobbies is helping people recover data from old tape cartridges, such as QIC-80 tapes, which were a rather popular backup medium in the 1990s among individuals, small businesses, BBS operators, and the like. I have a soft spot for tape media; there’s something about the tactile sensation of holding these tapes in my hands that makes the whole process very joyful, even though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-inch_cartridge">QIC</a> tapes are notorious for their many design flaws. With some careful inspection and reconditioning, the data on these tapes is still totally recoverable, even after all these years.</p>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/dc2120.jpg" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>Whenever I receive a QIC-80 tape for recovery, I power up one of my older PC workstations which has the appropriate tape drive attached to it, and boot into a very <a href="https://dmitrybrant.com/2023/09/30/brain-dump-september-2023">old version</a> of Linux (namely CentOS 3.5), because this is the only way to use the <code>ftape</code> driver, which is the kernel driver necessary for communicating with this tape drive, allowing the user to dump the binary contents of the tape.</p>
<p>You see, the drive that reads these tapes connects to the <em>floppy controller</em> on the motherboard. This clever hack was done as a cost-saving measure: instead of having to purchase a separate SCSI adapter (the standard interface for higher-tier tape media), you can just connect this tape drive to your floppy controller, which was already available on most PCs. It can even work alongside your existing floppy drive, on the same ribbon cable! The tradeoff, of course, is that the data rate is limited by the speed of the floppy controller, which was something like 500 Kbps (that’s kilobits, not bytes).</p>
<p>The other downside is that the protocol for communicating with these tape drives through the floppy controller was very messy, nonstandard, and not very well-supported. It was a “hack” in every sense: your motherboard’s BIOS had no knowledge of the tape drive being connected, and it was entirely up to the end-user software to know exactly how to manipulate the hardware I/O ports, timings, interrupts, etc. to trick the floppy controller into sending the appropriate commands to the tape drive.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/centos35_a.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>There were a small number of proprietary tools for MS-DOS and Windows 3.x/9x for dealing with these drives, and only one open-source implementation for Linux, namely <code>ftape</code>. Of course it is possible to use those original DOS/Windows tools to read the tapes, but it’s actually only <code>ftape</code> that allows us to read the “raw” binary contents of the tape, regardless of which proprietary software originally wrote it, which is why I prefer it for dumping the contents and worrying afterwards about decoding the proprietary logical formatting, and then extracting the files from it.</p>
<p>The trouble is, the <code>ftape</code> driver hasn’t been supported since roughly the year 2000, and was soon removed from the Linux kernel for this reason. This is why I’ve needed to run a painfully old version of Linux anytime I have to work with one of these drives. It would be great if <code>ftape</code> worked on a modern distro, with all the benefits and affordances that would provide.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>So a couple of weeks ago, it occurred to me to make a simple request to Claude Code:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; This repository is a Linux kernel driver that communicates with legacy tape drives connected to the floppy
  controller (FDC) on the motherboard. Unfortunately, this driver hasn't been maintained for a long time, and
  can only compile under kernel version 2.4. I'd like to modernize this driver, allowing it to be built with
  the latest versions of the kernel.

● I'll help you modernize this Linux kernel driver for legacy tape drives. This is a significant task that
  will require updating the code to work with modern kernel APIs and conventions.
</code></pre>
<p>And after several iterations of “combobulating” and whatever else Claude claims to do, I suddenly had a kernel driver that was compiling without errors. This is because Claude is able to take the compiler output and feed it back into itself, until the compilation works correctly. There was a laundry list of kernel functions and structures that were understandably deprecated or replaced, in the eternity that elapsed between kernel version 2.4 and version 6.8. Amazingly, Claude found all the outdated bits and replaced them with the correct modern equivalents, requiring just a few manual touch-ups of the code (a bit more on this later).</p>
<p>At this point, however, the kernel driver was still expected to be compiled as part of a full kernel tree, whereas I just wanted it to become a standalone loadable kernel module. OK, no problem:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Is there a way to compile just this module in-place, instead of copying it into a kernel source tree?

● Yes! You can compile kernel modules out-of-tree without copying them into the kernel source. Let me create
  a proper standalone build system for the ftape driver.
</code></pre>
<p>…And it did. Without any further prompting. At the end of this stage, I had a loadable kernel module (<code>.ko</code>) that I could start trying to use with actual live hardware. Unsurprisingly, the module did not yet “work” — it was loading, but something was preventing it from communicating with the tape drive correctly. But I pressed on.</p>
<p>From this point forward, since loading/unloading kernel modules requires sudo, I could no longer let Claude “iterate” on such sensitive operations by itself. Luckily, the <code>ftape</code> driver was already generously sprinkled with logging messages (<code>printk()</code> calls that are printed to <code>dmesg</code>), so I loaded the module myself, and iteratively pasted the output of <code>dmesg</code> into Claude manually, and let Claude compare it to a “known-good” dmesg log that I’d previously saved from a successful tape read. After a few iterations of this, Claude identified the remaining issues preventing the module from communicating with the hardware.</p>
<pre><code>● Perfect! The module has parameters that can be set. The issue is that without configuration, all the base
  addresses default to -1, which gets converted to 0xffff in the config function, causing the detection to fail.
● The "No such device or address" (ENXIO) error occurs because the ftape-internal module is not configured
  with the correct I/O port base address for your floppy controller.
  The issue is in fdc-internal.c:735-737: if fdc-&gt;sra == 0xffff, it returns -ENXIO. Since no configuration was
  provided, all values default to -1, which becomes 0xffff....
</code></pre>
<p>And at last, I had a kernel module that was able to a) load, b) detect the tape drive, and c) dump the contents of a test tape!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/colo250_1.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Using the <code>ftape</code> driver on a modern kernel, a feat that I thought was hopelessly out of reach, was <a href="https://github.com/dbrant/ftape">suddenly completed</a> <strong>over the course of two evenings</strong>.</p>
<p>As a giant caveat, I should note that I have a small bit of prior experience working with kernel modules, and a good amount of experience with C in general, so I don’t want to overstate Claude’s success in this scenario. As in, it wasn’t <em>literally</em> three prompts to get Claude to poop out a working kernel module, but rather several back-and-forth conversations and, yes, several manual fixups of the code. It would <em>absolutely not</em> be possible to perform this modernization without a baseline knowledge of the internals of a kernel module.</p>
<p>This led me to crystallize some thoughts on working with such coding agents in our current moment:</p>
<h4>Open yourself up to a genuine collaboration with these tools.</h4>
<p>Interacting with Claude Code felt like an actual collaboration with a fellow engineer. People like to compare it to working with a “junior” engineer, and I think that’s broadly accurate: it will do whatever you tell it to do, it’s eager to please, it’s overconfident, it’s quick to apologize and praise you for being “absolutely right” when you point out a mistake it made, and so on. Because of this, you (the human) are still the one who must provide the guardrails, make product decisions, enforce architectural guidelines, and spot potential problems as early as possible.</p>
<h4>Be as specific as possible, making sure to use the domain-specific keywords for the task.</h4>
<p>I’m not claiming to suddenly be an expert in prompt engineering, but the prompts that I’ve found to be most successful are ones that clearly lay out the verbal scaffolding for a feature, and then describe the gaps in the scaffolding that the LLM should fill in. (For some reason the image that comes to mind is one of those biological stem-cell scaffolds where an artificial human ear will grow.)</p>
<h4>Develop an intuition for the kinds of tasks that are “well-suited” for an agent to complete.</h4>
<p>These agents are not magical, and can’t do literally everything you ask. If you ask it to do something for which it’s not well-suited, you will become frustrated and prematurely reject these tools before you allow them to shine. On this point, it’s useful to learn how LLMs actually work, so that you develop a sense of their strengths and <a href="https://dmitrybrant.com/2023/03/25/artificial-stupidity">weaknesses</a>.</p>
<h4>Use these tools as a massive force multiplier of your own skills.</h4>
<p>I’m sure that if I really wanted to, I could have done this modernization effort on my own. But that would have required me to learn kernel development <em>as it was done 25 years ago</em>. This would have probably taken me several weeks of nonstop poring over documentation that would be <em>completely useless knowledge</em> today. Instead of all that, I spent a couple of days chatting with an agent and having it explain to me all the things it did.</p>
<p>Naturally, I verified and tested the changes it made, and in the process I did end up learning a huge amount of things that will be <em>actually useful</em> to me in the future, such as modern kernel conventions, some interesting details of x86 architecture, as well as several command line incantations that I’ll be keeping in my arsenal.</p>
<h4>Use these tools for rapid onboarding onto new frameworks.</h4>
<p>I am not a kernel developer by any stretch, but this particular experience ignited a spark that might lead to more kernel-level work, and it turns out that kernel development isn’t nearly as difficult as it might sound. In another unrelated “vibe-coding” session, I built a Flutter app without having used Flutter before. If you’re like me, and your learning style is to learn by doing, these tools can radically accelerate your pace of learning new frameworks, freeing you up to do more high-level architectural thinking.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In any case, circling all the way back, I am now happy to say that <code>ftape</code> <a href="https://github.com/dbrant/ftape">lives on</a>! Twenty-five years after its last official release, it is once again buildable and usable on modern Linux. I’m still in the process of making some further tweaks and new feature additions, but I have already verified that it works with the floppy-based tape drives in <a href="https://dmitrybrant.com/inventory-media">my collection</a>, as well as parallel-port-based drives which it also supports.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/ftape_2025.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>The physical setup looks very similar, but the OS is now Xubuntu 24.04, instead of CentOS 3.5! 🎉<br>
Until next time!</p>

He worked on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)">Ada</a> compiler and
has been programming since the early 80s.</p>
<p>One day I complained about linter tooling that
was driving me nuts. I said something to the effect of, "it's 2016, how are we still dealing with this sort of thing?"</p>
<p>Turns out, that problem was solved four decades ago (well, three at that point). Back when he was working on Ada,
they didn't store text sources at all — they used an <abbr title="Intermediate representation">IR</abbr> called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" href="https://archive.org/details/dianaintermediat0000unse/page/n7/mode/2up">DIANA</a>.
Everyone had their own pretty-printing settings for viewing it however they wanted.</p>
<p>We've been debating some linter settings at work recently and I keep thinking back to
Mr. Paige. It's 2025, how are we still dealing with this sort of thing?</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, to answer that it would help to know what we're missing.</p>
<p>I believe he was working with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_R1000">Rational R1000</a>, of which there isn't a ton of info
(like all things Ada, it was used by the DoD):</p>

<p>The R1000 had a lot of bleeding-edge features: incremental compilation, semantic analysis, version control, and first-class debugging all built-in. It was a workstation similar to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto">Xerox Alto</a> but using Ada instead of Smalltalk.</p>

<p>Instead of storing plain-text source code, the R1000 wrote DIANA.
The compiler and the IDE built into the machine both understood DIANA too, so you could view the source however you wanted.
Spaces vs. tabs didn't matter because neither affects the semantics and the editor on the system let you modify the program tree directly (known today as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ProjectionalEditing.html">projectional editing</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>R1000 was effectively a DIANA machine. We didn't store source code: source code was simply a pretty-printing of the DIANA tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine that.
No wasted time due to formatting discussions or fighting linters,
without forcing everyone into the same editor setup (looking at you, eslint-config-airbnb).</p>
<p>And there were other benefits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using DIANA with hardware acceleration made it possible to do incremental compilation (unheard of at the time, for strongly typed languages), easy refactoring (though that word had not yet been invented), and incredibly fast integration (essential for the large systems that we being built with Ada).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, we don't need to worry about hardware-accelerated compilation (hopefully),
and we have better tools for refactoring (thanks, Claude). But with formatting, we regressed.
I'm not advocating for everyone to use projectional editing and a live environment (although I think they're awesome and we should be exploring them more),
but surely we can figure out something that fits into todays programming paradigms.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>
<i>Autumn 2025</i>
</p>

<p>
The demo scene was recently proclaimed a <a href="https://levandekulturarv.se/forteckningen/element/demoscenen">UNESCO Living Cultural Heritage</a> in Sweden, following several other European nations. As a scener, I'm not quite sure how I feel about that. It's amusing on some level, there's maybe even a bit of pride involved, but also fear that it might bring unwanted attention to a Good Thing, because Good Things are always at risk of spoiling when receiving too much attention. Then again, such worries are probably unfounded. Despite being a living cultural heritage, the demo scene is - all things considered - slowly approaching its demise.
</p>

<h3>
The Scene Isn't Dead
</h3>

<p>
The scene - incorporating the cracking scene of the 1980s and early 1990s - has been declared dead several times over since the late 1980s. Some claimed the Amiga would kill it, others that the PC would destroy its soul or that the Internet would rob it of its essence. This is to be expected: In a subculture - which is what the scene is - there's typically going to be elders lamenting the changing of the old ways, and newcomers eager to bring their own ideas into the mix.
</p>

<p>
Except... That last part might no longer apply to the scene. Examine photos from a late 1980s rave party and they'll show a bunch of young people partying hard. Fast forward in time and look at photos from a 2025 rave party, and the concept remains basically the same, but there's now a different bunch of young people partying hard. When performing the same experiment on the scene, there's close to zero teenagers among 2025 demo party attendants. Look closer and it becomes evident that many of the 2025 attendants are in fact <i>the very same persons</i> as the teenagers and twenty-somethings appearing in party photos from 1989.
</p>

<p>
Some subcultures are regularly replenished or revived, whereas <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swingpjatt">others</a> are not. The scene seems to fall distinctly into the latter category: With few exceptions, most active sceners - even those who create demos for modern gaming PCs - belong to the <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/hcg/">home computer generation</a>, meaning people who remember the heydays of Commodore, Atari, Amiga and MS-DOS.
</p>

<h3>
High Effort, Low Reward
</h3>

<p>
Like most subcultures, the scene grew out of a mix of unique circumstances at a very particular point in time; specifically, the advent of affordable but primitive home computers, lack of accessible digital mass communication, and <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/sceneorig/">limited cultural precedent</a>.
</p>

<p>
I believe that all subcultures need a bit of gatekeeping in order to retain their original soul - the more accessible they are, the easier it is to turn them into exploitable markets. Punks, hippies and mods have all been removed from their original context, ground through a mainstream cultural filter, and repurposed for consumerism: A convenient way of selling brand apparel to identity-seeking middle class youth hungry for something, anything, ostensibly genuine.
</p>

<p>
The scene, on the other hand, is a perfect example of a subculture that's hard to repackage for sale: It lacks apparent external traits, such as a particular fashion, a specific style of music and - especially considering how common computers are today - any uniquely defining equipment.
</p>

<p>
Combined with its shadier activities - cracking games, software piracy, postage fraud and phreaking - the scene was always on the introverted side. Decidedly <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/scenecop/">anti-commercial</a> and without tangible and marketable artifacts, corporate interest was and is usually limited to a few sponsors at really large demo parties, and using the scene as a recruitment pool for game developers. Apart from the time and effort required to build <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/scenearch/">scene skills</a>, computers and other traditionally geeky hobbies were decidedly low status in the schoolyard pecking order during the formative years of scene culture. Hence, there was very little potential reward in <i>pretending</i> to be someone who hunkered down in front of a CRT all weekend, trying to move a sprite across the screen. And, let's be frank, it never did attract very many <a href="https://datagubbe.se/girls/">girls</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thus, unlike other skill-based subcultures with a bigger mainstream appeal and a more pronounced aesthetic - such as skateboarding - the effort required to be accepted by the in-group and the low potential of reward from the out-group, means the scene has never interested posers in any significant numbers. It simply never became <i>cool</i>, and, consequently, still remains well out of view from establishment actors. I happen to like it that way.
</p>

<h3>
Still Not Mainstream
</h3>

<p>
There are regular discussions on the scene about how to attract new talent, because newcomers are nowadays few and far between. I believe the effort to get listed as a living cultural heritage is, in some way, part of a desire to rejuvenate the scene and keep the culture alive. Time will tell if it's successful - I have serious doubts.
</p>

<p>
It's not that it's hard to get accepted on the scene, especially not these days. Talk of <i>lamers</i> and <i>elites</i> is now just self-referential irony, and the cracking scene is much farther removed from demo making than ever before. The mystery of what a demo actually <i>is</i> has been well documented, not least on Wikipedia, and examples are prevalent on easy access platforms like Youtube. To partake, all that's required is (preferably) going to a demo party, talking to people, and bringing something to the table. Congratulations - you are now a scener!
</p>

<p>
If measured in number of active participants, the scene peaked somewhere during the early 1990s, when parties like Assembly, The Party and The Gathering attracted visitors in the thousands. Since then, attendance has dwindled, and has proven hard to increase again despite various outreach initiatives.
</p>

<h3>
Kill All Audio and Lights
</h3>

<p>
During the latter half of the 1990s, big demo parties started attracting people almost exclusively interested in playing networked games at scale, effectively visiting parties to use the digital infrastructure they provided. In theory, this could have been an opportunity for the scene to grow, gaining a natural venue for showcasing itself to a new audience apparently interested in computers. In reality, few gamers made the leap, and subcultural differences instead created friction. Sceners were annoyed by gamers disturbing the demo competitions with loud music and other disruptive behavior, and ticket prices went up due to increased demand. Some events were completely taken over by gamers: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamHack">Dreamhack</a> started as a small demo party and is now a global LAN party franchise. Eventually, sceners simply retreated to other venues, in a natural and uneventful split.
</p>

<p>
There are still hybrid events, but the biggest, most popular and influential parties are once again exclusive to the scene - not by actively banning a certain category of visitors, but by simply organizing and marketing scene events in a way that makes them inherently uninteresting for the average LAN party visitor.
</p>

<p>
Arguably successful hybrids, such as what Assembly has transformed into, has more or less compartmentalized the scene in order to protect it from the otherwise completely dominating and highly commercialized mix of e-sports, cosplay and live music acts. During the 1990s, many big parties offered cash prizes, and Assembly is as far as I know the last one that still does. In an outreach effort, they've also introduced a compo segment specifically for beginner sceners and this does seem to attract a number of first releases each year. A positive sign, though I personally feel a bit squeamish about keeping money in the mix: the vast majority of productions released, even during the peak party years, were never created for winning money, but because it was fun.
</p>

<h3>
Why Grow?
</h3>

<p>
For most sceners, the scene was a part of their formative teenage years. Lasting friendships, life-long skills and creative exploration is the stuff of fond memories, and our pursuits are still a source of much joy. It's only natural to want to share this positive experience with others. Some seem to think the scene could still be a potential talent pool, lamenting the lack of new scene recruits for low level programming jobs and game development. And, of course, it might be comforting to see a cultural legacy carried on: a validation of your own life choices. However, as heartwarming as it is to see new, younger talents appear on the scene, the slow trickle appears to be well below meaningful replacement levels: we're very far from the hundreds or even thousands of youngsters that once hiked across Europe to fill giant convention centers.
</p>

<p>
What makes rejuvenation hard is that many of the things that once gave the scene its special allure are simply gone. There are no longer home computers offering a fixed hardware platform for exploring, sharing and creating on equal footing. Spreading digital creations is cheap and easy on an Internet taken for granted. Affordable yet immensely powerful computers have opened up entirely new creative avenues, unhindered by the technical limitations that once upon a time forced the essence of demos to become what it is. And, of course, the scene is no longer new and exciting, but filled with middle-aged grown-ups.
</p>

<h3>
Degrowth
</h3>

<p>
The scene grew organically through devoted and creative people, hell-bent on doing their own thing without the involvement of clueless adults, corporate incentives or detailed career prospects. It was and remains, first and foremost, about challenging yourself and sharing a passion. It's not the scene's responsibility to supply the software industry with capable developers, and it's certainly not the responsibility of today's teenagers to fill the ranks of a peculiar hacker niche - one based on unwritten rules thought up four decades ago by a bunch of old fogeys who are, to a large extent, still farting around with MS-DOS, 6510 CPUs and blitter chips.
</p>

<p>
There are other venues today where kids can experiment, learn and build a social context around their activities - probably ones where clueless adults can be kept at arm's length. If they want to join the scene, let them - but above all, let them find their own thing, invent their own creative ways, and let them enjoy doing so.
</p>

<p>
As for me, I'm fine with the seemingly unavoidable, generational death of the scene. I crave no subcultural legacy, no future audience for my present creative pursuits. I'm just happy to be left alone in my narrow little niche, enjoying it with like-minded individuals, far from the scrutiny of commercial interests and other potential threats to our Good Thing.
</p>

<p>
And if a significant number of kids do, in fact, eventually pick up the scene torch? Well, I just hope they'll have fun, too.

                        <!-- Contentteller Template: publish_teaser_image -->
                        <p><img src="https://www.guru3d.com/data/teaser/226/6753fd87e6666db8f2259163bf50d41576c11c/890890.webp" alt="teaser"></p><p>Intel has officially expanded its professional GPU portfolio with the launch of the Arc Pro B50, designed specifically for small-form-factor workstations. The card is based on the Battlemage BMG-G21 GPU, configured with 16 Xe2 cores. It comes paired with 16 GB of GDDR6 VRAM clocked at 14 Gbps on a 128-bit memory bus, producing 224 GB/s of effective bandwidth. This configuration ensures that the GPU cores are properly fed while maintaining a low overall power draw. Intel has kept the total board power at 70 W, enabling the card to run entirely from the PCIe slot without external connectors. With a PCIe Gen 5 x8 interface, the Pro B50 balances efficiency and bandwidth for professional workloads.

One of the key features of the Arc Pro B50 is its suitability for AI workloads and specialized professional applications. Intel claims performance of up to 170 TOPS in INT8 compute, which is significant for local AI inference tasks, machine learning workloads, and data preprocessing. Beyond AI, the GPU is optimized for CAD, engineering, architectural visualization, and design software, where stability is just as important as raw throughput. To meet these needs, Intel supplies a certified workstation driver stack, ensuring predictable performance across industry-standard applications. The physical design reflects its target environment: the card uses a low-profile dual-slot form factor, making it ideal for dense workstation cases that prioritize both space savings and airflow efficiency.
                                    </p><p>Display connectivity is handled via <strong>four mini DisplayPort outputs</strong>, which support multi-monitor setups critical for professional users who often work with complex datasets or design layouts. By providing flexibility in display configuration while maintaining a small footprint, Intel positions the Arc Pro B50 as a versatile tool for both AI and visual workflows. The emphasis is not on competing with high-end workstation GPUs in sheer raw power, but on striking a balance between <strong>price, efficiency, and reliability</strong> in scenarios where compact workstations are used.</p>

<p>With an <strong>MSRP of $349</strong>, Intel has aimed for the Arc Pro B50 to be an accessible entry into the workstation GPU segment. The card will be distributed both as a standalone retail product and through <strong>OEM workstation systems</strong>. At launch, early reviews from outlets such as HardwareLuxx, Phoronix, and Igor’s LAB indicate that the card delivers consistent results within its targeted workloads, rather than focusing on gaming performance. As Intel continues to invest in both consumer and professional graphics solutions, the Arc Pro B50 demonstrates a focus on <strong>specialized, compact, and power-efficient GPU offerings</strong> that broaden its reach in the professional computing market.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Sim Wong Hoo was born on the 28th of April in 1955, the tenth child in a family of twelve children (five brothers, seven sisters). His family were Singaporean Hoklo with ancestry in the southernmost area of Fujian, China, and they spoke Hokkien. He grew up in a kampung called End of Coconut Hill in Bukit Panjang, and his father, Sim Chye Thiam, was a factory worker while his mother, Tan Siok Kee, raised chickens, ducks, pigs, and rabbits, and grew fruits and herbs. The young Sim had chores around the house and around the farm as soon as he was physically able, and he often sold eggs at the local market before school classes started each day. This afforded him the ability to buy things for himself such as his harmonica when he was about 11. The harmonica was a hobby he greatly enjoyed throughout his life. He also enjoyed making his own games.</p><p>Sim graduated from Bukit Panjang Government High School and then went on to attend Ngee Ann Technical College for engineering. At the college, Sim was a member of both the harmonica troupe, consisting of thirty people, and the Practice Theatre School. In the theatre, Sim provided musical accompaniment for the school’s performances with the harmonica and the accordion, often performing his own arrangements. His two interests collided at this time in his life. When writing or arranging music, he’d only be able to hear his composition during weekly practice. Having seen a computer, he realized that a computer could allow him to hear the music precisely as written while still working on it. Sim envisioned a computer that could play music, talk, or even sing, and his earlier entrepreneurial spirit drove him to an ambitious goal: selling 100 million units of a single piece of equipment. Sim graduated in 1975 and then entered the uniformed services for his obligatory two years.</p><p>For three to four years following his service, Sim worked a brief stint on an offshore oil rig, designing computerized seismic data logging equipment. After that, he opened a computer education center at Coronation Plaza. As he was more interested in teaching and researching, he left the business work to his business partner. This wasn’t a great decision. His partner took off with all the money.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Gzjk!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F235b1ef7-4a78-4131-bb12-8c27629c25d6_890x519.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Gzjk!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F235b1ef7-4a78-4131-bb12-8c27629c25d6_890x519.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Gzjk!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F235b1ef7-4a78-4131-bb12-8c27629c25d6_890x519.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Gzjk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F235b1ef7-4a78-4131-bb12-8c27629c25d6_890x519.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Gzjk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F235b1ef7-4a78-4131-bb12-8c27629c25d6_890x519.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Gzjk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F235b1ef7-4a78-4131-bb12-8c27629c25d6_890x519.jpeg" width="890" height="519" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/235b1ef7-4a78-4131-bb12-8c27629c25d6_890x519.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:519,&quot;width&quot;:890,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:135618,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.abortretry.fail/i/153636346?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F235b1ef7-4a78-4131-bb12-8c27629c25d6_890x519.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Gzjk!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F235b1ef7-4a78-4131-bb12-8c27629c25d6_890x519.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Gzjk!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F235b1ef7-4a78-4131-bb12-8c27629c25d6_890x519.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Gzjk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F235b1ef7-4a78-4131-bb12-8c27629c25d6_890x519.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Gzjk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F235b1ef7-4a78-4131-bb12-8c27629c25d6_890x519.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Sim Wong Hoo with a variety of Creative products</figcaption></figure></div><p>On the 1st of July in 1981, Sim founded Creative Technology with Ng Kai Wa, who had been his childhood friend and classmate in a 440 sqft shop at Pearls Center using his own savings of around $6000.

With nearly zero software support for anything approaching the capabilities of the CT and an even smaller local market, the product was a failure.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iXha!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71c77fea-fd7d-42f4-89bf-22ee4148e9de_1190x1598.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iXha!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71c77fea-fd7d-42f4-89bf-22ee4148e9de_1190x1598.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iXha!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71c77fea-fd7d-42f4-89bf-22ee4148e9de_1190x1598.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iXha!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71c77fea-fd7d-42f4-89bf-22ee4148e9de_1190x1598.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iXha!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71c77fea-fd7d-42f4-89bf-22ee4148e9de_1190x1598.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iXha!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71c77fea-fd7d-42f4-89bf-22ee4148e9de_1190x1598.jpeg" width="1190" height="1598" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/71c77fea-fd7d-42f4-89bf-22ee4148e9de_1190x1598.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1598,&quot;width&quot;:1190,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iXha!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71c77fea-fd7d-42f4-89bf-22ee4148e9de_1190x1598.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iXha!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71c77fea-fd7d-42f4-89bf-22ee4148e9de_1190x1598.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iXha!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71c77fea-fd7d-42f4-89bf-22ee4148e9de_1190x1598.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iXha!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71c77fea-fd7d-42f4-89bf-22ee4148e9de_1190x1598.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Creative Music System advertisement</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Realizing that the sound features of the CUBIC CT were likely more salable and supportable than the computer itself, Sim and his company chose to sell the sound card by itself as the Creative Music System (also C/MS or CT-1300).

The inclusion of those drivers was key to what would follow. Creative’s partnership with Sierra meant that some of the most popular games of the era would support the Game Blaster; ultimately, over 100 games would support the C/MS and Game Blaster. Naturally, selling a card required a store front, and Creative found a partner in Radio Shack.

This came in 1989 with the CT1310, better known as the Sound Blaster. The Sound Blaster offered 12-voice C/MS stereo sound, 11-voice FM synthesis with Adlib compatibility (via the Yamaha YM3812), a MIDI interface, a joystick port, microphone jack with a built-in amplifier, a stereo amplifier with volume dial, the ability to play back mono-sampled sound at up to 22kHz, and record at 12kHz. While a sample rate of 22k doesn’t seem great (because it isn’t) this did allow simultaneous output of sound effects and music in a game. Likewise, while a game port doesn’t seem like all too big a deal, it saved the buyer an extra $50 to buy one separately, and it saved an ISA slot too. The Sound Blaster was the first sound card to feature digital sample playback, and it took over the market, quickly becoming the top-selling expansion card of any kind in under a year, and Creative’s revenues hit $5.5 million. With the C/MS never having been too popular, Creative followed the CT1310 with the CT1320 which removed the C/MS chips but kept sockets for them on the card.</p><p>1989 also saw Creative release the PJS operating system and the PJ Views word processor and desktop publishing system which included support for 70,000 Chinese characters. As far as I know, these products were only released in Southeast Asia.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Sound Blaster Pro, CT1330, was a major redesign of Creative’s sound card. This card used two Yamaha YM3812 chips to provide stereo sound while maintaining full backward compatibility with the original Sound Blaster and Adlib. Sample rates were increased to 22kHz for stereo, 44.1kHz for mono. A simple mixer, low-pass filter, high-pass filter, and CD-ROM interface were added. This CD-ROM interface could take multiple forms, but it was useful in pushing CD-ROMs into the mainstream. Many early CD-ROM drives were SCSI-only and that was expensive. Creative worked with MKE in Japan to produce low-cost IDE CD-ROM drives, and then included support on their cards. As for the card itself, while the card did have the AT connector, it wasn’t 16bit. The Pro was still an 8bit card. The presence of the 16bit AT connector was for additional interrupts and DMAs on the 16bit bus that supported the Multimedia PC standard from Microsoft. The Sound Blaster Pro 2 was released shortly after the original, and it replaced the YM3812s with a single YMF262. The Pro series was often sold in Multimedia Upgrade Kits where it was bundled with a CD-ROM drive and software titles. Given that CD-ROMs were quite new, these kits often represented a significant value to consumers.</p><p><span>This card can also be found in Tandy Multimedia PCs as the </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-tandy-corporation-part-1" rel="">Tandy</a><span> Multimedia Audio Adapter. Immediately noticeable changes were from the regular joystick port to two mini-DIN connectors compatible with the Tandy 1000 joysticks, and the addition of a mini-DIN MIDI port. For both the joystick connectors and MIDI connector, adapters were required. A less noticeable change, the Tandy card used a different bus interface chip, the CT1346, and the output amplifier could be disabled via a jumper. Finally, the card featured a high-DMA channel allocated for audio which allowed 16bit 44.1kHz mono output in Windows.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!so9N!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0f0e2c0-5746-4777-987c-ceff23f8b6da_5750x3794.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!so9N!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0f0e2c0-5746-4777-987c-ceff23f8b6da_5750x3794.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!so9N!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0f0e2c0-5746-4777-987c-ceff23f8b6da_5750x3794.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!so9N!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0f0e2c0-5746-4777-987c-ceff23f8b6da_5750x3794.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!so9N!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0f0e2c0-5746-4777-987c-ceff23f8b6da_5750x3794.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!so9N!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0f0e2c0-5746-4777-987c-ceff23f8b6da_5750x3794.jpeg" width="1456" height="961" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e0f0e2c0-5746-4777-987c-ceff23f8b6da_5750x3794.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:961,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!so9N!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0f0e2c0-5746-4777-987c-ceff23f8b6da_5750x3794.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!so9N!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0f0e2c0-5746-4777-987c-ceff23f8b6da_5750x3794.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!so9N!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0f0e2c0-5746-4777-987c-ceff23f8b6da_5750x3794.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!so9N!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0f0e2c0-5746-4777-987c-ceff23f8b6da_5750x3794.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Creative Sound Blaster, CT1350b, image from theretroweb.com</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The Sound Blaster 2, or Sound Blaster Deluxe, model CT1350 was released in October of 1991. This model improved the board layout allowing for a more compact card, and it completely eliminated the C/MS chips. This model improved on its predecessor by adding auto-init to DMA allowing the card to play continuously without the crackling or pausing that was experienced on the original. The sample rate for digital audio on this card was increased to 44kHz for playback and to 15kHz for recording. With this card, a DSP upgrade was made available to owners of the original Sound Blaster, which was required for full compatibility with the </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-windows-3" rel="">Windows 3</a><span> multimedia extensions.</span></p><p><span>Creative was growing quickly, achieving an estimated 72% market share of the sound card market globally in 1992, but it was also facing significant competition. Media Vision’s Pro Audio Spectrum Plus, released in 1991, was capable of 8bit digital sampling and 16bit digital audio playback. It featured a CD-ROM interface, and it was Sound Blaster compatible. The Pro Audio Spectrum 16 of 1992 moved the company to 16bit ISA, added 16bit stereo digital audio, and featured stereo FM synthesis while maintaining full Sound Blaster compatibility. Then, there was Aztech in the more low-end market making some serious OEM deals with likes of </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/dude-youre-gettin-a-dell" rel="">Dell</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/compaq-computer-corporation-part" rel="">Compaq</a><span>.

This was a fully 16bit sound card and featured support for 16bit 44.1kHz digital audio. Creative had partnered with E-mu Systems to offer the Wave Blaster daughter board that brought wavetable synthesis to card through the header on the top of the card. The empty socket seen on the SB16 was for the Creative Signal Processor, CT1748, which brought hardware-assisted speech synthesis, </span><em>QSound</em><span> audio spatialization for digital wave playback, and PCM audio compression/decompression. The SB16 was more popular than any card before it, and the wavetable daughter board was popular enough to push Creative to acquire E-mu in March of 1993 for $54 million.</span></p><p><span>Creative went public in August of 1992 and became the first Singaporean company to be listed on the NASDAQ. In September of 1992, Creative expanded into China establishing a joint venture in Beijing called Chuang Tong Multimedia Computer Ltd. Creative held 70%, NewStone 20%, and Da Heng 10%. In addition to selling the company’s multimedia hardware, the Chinese subsidiary developed and distributed CD-ROM software in the Chinese language, and sold PJS and PJ Views.

He began licensing programs, shortened product development cycles, and began legal endeavors to protect Creative’s intellectual property. Throughout 1993, Creative established itself Australia, Japan, the UK, and Ireland. Finally, that same year, Creative acquired ShareVision Technology who made videoconferencing technologies.

With the SB16, ViBRA, and AWE32 on the market, the company’s revenues exceeded $650 million, and the company was listed on the Singapore stock exchange.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ml1B!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6adf3bf3-198b-4c72-9bf7-282b36df8a03_1764x2454.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ml1B!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6adf3bf3-198b-4c72-9bf7-282b36df8a03_1764x2454.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ml1B!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6adf3bf3-198b-4c72-9bf7-282b36df8a03_1764x2454.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ml1B!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6adf3bf3-198b-4c72-9bf7-282b36df8a03_1764x2454.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ml1B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6adf3bf3-198b-4c72-9bf7-282b36df8a03_1764x2454.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ml1B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6adf3bf3-198b-4c72-9bf7-282b36df8a03_1764x2454.png" width="1456" height="2026" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6adf3bf3-198b-4c72-9bf7-282b36df8a03_1764x2454.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2026,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:7336223,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.abortretry.fail/i/153636346?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6adf3bf3-198b-4c72-9bf7-282b36df8a03_1764x2454.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ml1B!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6adf3bf3-198b-4c72-9bf7-282b36df8a03_1764x2454.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ml1B!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6adf3bf3-198b-4c72-9bf7-282b36df8a03_1764x2454.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ml1B!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6adf3bf3-198b-4c72-9bf7-282b36df8a03_1764x2454.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ml1B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6adf3bf3-198b-4c72-9bf7-282b36df8a03_1764x2454.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>On the 26th of October in 1994, in time for the Christmas shopping season, Creative released the 3DO Blaster. This brought 3DO games to the PC via a full-length, 16bit, ISA card. On the card was a 32bit RISC CPU, a DSP for CD audio, two graphics processors, 2MB of RAM, 1MB of ROM, 1MB of VRAM, and 32K SRAM with battery backup. The box contained two games (Shockwave, Gridders), some demos, drivers, Aldus Photostyler and Gallery Effects, a controller, manuals, the card itself, and a registration card. Of course, the 3DO blaster was not, itself, a standard VGA card. To use the 3DO Blaster, one’s PC would need to be at least a 25MHz Intel 386, have at least 4MB of RAM, a VGA card, Windows 3.1, a CD-ROM drive (either Matsushita or Creative CR-564), a Sound Blaster, and some speakers. The press release from 3DO read, in part:</p><blockquote><p><em>With the introduction of 3DO Blaster, Creative is targeting their extensive installed base of CD-ROM users. 3DO Blaster provides PC owners with the ultimate game platform — exciting 3DO games recognized for unprecedented interactive realism, full-motion video, CD-quality audio and three-dimensional sound effects.</em></p><p><em>“Today’s announcement reflects the efforts of two of the most advanced technology suppliers, Creative Technology and 3DO. The 3DO Blaster provides the advantage of Creative’s and 3DO’s innovation to the installed base of PC’s already using Creative multimedia products,” said Sim Wong Hoo, CEO and chairman of Creative Technology Ltd.</em></p><p><em>“Creative’s and 3DO’s technologies create an advanced entertainment platform which will enhance the capabilities of PCs, and expand the imagination of users by providing them access to exciting, interactive products that fully exploit the potential of multimedia entertainment.”</em></p><p><em>Trip Hawkins, president and CEO of The 3DO Company, said today’s announcement enables his company to expand quickly and aggressively into the vast PC market. “Creative is the leading supplier of multimedia products for PCs, providing us with the opportunity to deliver 3DO’s advanced interactive technology to an even broader audience,” said Hawkins.</em></p></blockquote><p>Given that the 3DO Blaster cost $399.95 and the 3DO console didn’t do too well, this product was moribund from the start. </p><p>Also in October of 1994, Creative released HansVision. This was a Chinese-language office suite for Windows, and while Windows replaced PJS, HansVision replaced PJ Views. Also in 1994, Creative acquired Digicom Systems, a modem company. This resulted in the Creative Phone Blaster in 1995. The Phone Blaster, CT3110, was largely just a ViBRA 16 with an integrated modem and a wavetable header, but it was a full-length, 16bit, ISA card. It faired better than the company’s attempts at video conferencing, but it wasn’t much of a success.</p><p>A cost reduced version of the AWE32 was released in 1995 as the Sound Blaster 32. It was roughly equivalent to the AWE32 but lacked the on-board RAM, Wave Blaster Support, and CSP. Additionally, it utilized the CQM chip from the ViBRA instead of the OPL3. The CQM (Creative Quadratic Modulation) commonly suffered audio clipping, hiss, and ringing when playing digital audio.</p><p>Esber, Buchanan, and Pomerantz left the company in 1995. They’d never really got on with the folks in Singapore, and the two groups had disagreements over the company’s strategy. Sorkin, however, was promoted to General Manager of the audio division, and then to executive VP of business development and corporate investments.</p><p>With the earlier success of the company’s CD-ROM and sound card bundles packing Matsushita, Mitsumi, and other vendors’ drives, Creative had gone into the CD-ROM drive business. In 1995, the industry had a large oversupply and Creative dumped its inventory incurring a loss of $30 million, and causing the company’s share price to drop nearly 75%.</p><div><figure><a

This was a 3D accelerator card built around the 3DLabs GLINT 300SX processor. The GLINT 300SX was built of about a million transistors on IBM’s 3.3V, 0.5 micron process, and it was capable of about 2.5 billion operations per second. As with many cards that would follow, GLINT was designed to process Gouraud-shaded, Z-buffered, dithered triangles that were generated by an application or game and passed to GLINT via the OpenGL API (in this case CGL, and later DirectX). The chip was accompanied by 2MB (or 4MB with the 2MB daughter board) of DRAM, and this VESA Local Bus card achieved a pixel filtrate of 25MP/s. The card cost $349.95 at launch and it only handled 3D, requiring the user to have a 2D card installed and use VGA passthrough. This was roughly a year before the first </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/so-powerful-its-kind-of-ridiculous" rel="">Voodoo</a><span> card, but shortly after the Diamond Edge 3D with an NV1 at $299 for 2MB. Given that this was a VLB card, the 3D Blaster was largely a card for 486 machines, and given the price, it didn’t sell well. As far as I am aware, there were roughly 13 game titles to support CGL. Of those, there was Rebel Moon which was exclusive to the CT6200, and even having been designed exclusively for this card, it wasn’t great. Frame rates would get quite sluggish at times, likely having been hampered by the 486 at the heart of VLB machines.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

improved on the AWE32 in a few ways. First, it increased the signal to noise ratio (especially in the Gold version), and increased component integration resulting in traces that likewise avoided noise. Given increases in integration, the board also became smaller than its predecessor and decreased cost. It’s also notable that with general technological advancements made in the industry, the ICs were of a consistently higher quality than those used in earlier cards despite being less expensive. The card came in two versions; one was the standard version which later was re-branded as the Value version (CT4500) with 512K RAM, and the other was the Gold version (CT4390) with 4MB of RAM, a 20bit DAC, and separate SPDIF output. Functionally, there were two major differences between the AWE64 and AWE32. The AWE64 added WaveGuide which synthesizes instrument sounds. While the Wave Blaster is no longer supported, the AWE64 Gold does have line inputs on the rear for an external Sound Canvas or similar product. Effectively, the WaveGuide feature allowed for greater polyphony through the use of 32 extra software-emulated channels, but in practice this used more CPU time and wasn’t very popular. The other change was the removal of 30-pin SIMM slots in favor of proprietary memory daughter boards. In all other respects, the AWE64 was simply a better AWE32. For purists, the AWE64 lacks Sound Blaster Pro compatibility and genuine OPL3 FM Synthesis, but for those who want SB16 compatibility, mostly noise-free output, hassle-free plug-n-play, and General MIDI capabilities, the AWE64 is wonderful. For collectors today, however, owning a genuine AWE64 Gold will set a buyer back between $200 and $400. That price will increase for those desiring a SIMMConn (replacing the proprietary memory daughter board with a 30-pin SIMM adapter).</p><p>Creative closed 1996 with $1.6 billion in revenues, and Sorkin left the company for Elon Musk’s Zip2.</p><p>Media Vision will get its own article at some point, but the company collapsed in a scandal, and Aureal Semiconductor was formed on the 9th of November in 1995 out of the prior company’s remnants. On the 14th of July in 1997, Aureal announced the Vortex AU8820 with high quality positional audio via the company’s A3D technology. This allowed a human listener to perceive audio as coming from a rather precise location, and it had originally been developed by Crystal River Engineering for NASA’s Virtual Environment Workstation Project. Crystal River had been acquired by Aureal in May of 1996, and Aureal productized the technology. The Vortex proved to be extremely popular and its features were supported by many of the most popular gaming titles of the time: Half-Life, Unreal, Quake II, and so on.</p><p><span>For Creative, the arrival of the Vortex card was existential. Most of the company’s revenues came from sound cards, and the Vortex had gained the respect of gamers and audiophiles almost immediately following its release. What was worse was that its feature set was being incorporated into games where once the Sound Blaster had been the de facto standard. The fastest way to gain expertise is to buy it, and Creative bought Ensoniq in January of 1998 for $77 million. Within Creative, Ensoniq was merged with E-mu Systems. The acquisition brought the Ensoniq AudioPCI into Creative, and this was a card intended to be cheap, functional, and feature rich. It supported digital effects such as reverb, chorus, and spatial enhancement, as well as DirectSound3D, and sample-based synthesis. For the new owner, the card couldn’t have been better as it support Sound Blaster compatibility through the use of a TSR despite being a </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/peripheral-component-interconnect" rel="">PCI</a><span> card. This card was rebranded several times as the Sound Blaster PCI 64, PCI 128, Vibra PCI and so on. The Ensoniq ES1370 that powered the card became the Creative 5507, and then revised into further AC97 variants. A major downside of the card was that it ran with a 44kHz sample rate only, and thus, audio recorded at any other rate was resampled which lowered fidelity and increased CPU time. The later AC97 variants supported only 48kHz natively, and therefore likewise resampled audio. While the AudioPCI wouldn’t win over audiophiles, its low cost moved units and won the company some OEM deals.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Pdu!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d640bb-fca6-480f-a7da-7eaf1a04365c_2448x1574.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Pdu!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d640bb-fca6-480f-a7da-7eaf1a04365c_2448x1574.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Pdu!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d640bb-fca6-480f-a7da-7eaf1a04365c_2448x1574.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Pdu!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d640bb-fca6-480f-a7da-7eaf1a04365c_2448x1574.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Pdu!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d640bb-fca6-480f-a7da-7eaf1a04365c_2448x1574.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Pdu!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d640bb-fca6-480f-a7da-7eaf1a04365c_2448x1574.png" width="1456" height="936" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b2d640bb-fca6-480f-a7da-7eaf1a04365c_2448x1574.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:936,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5984537,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.abortretry.fail/i/153636346?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d640bb-fca6-480f-a7da-7eaf1a04365c_2448x1574.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Pdu!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d640bb-fca6-480f-a7da-7eaf1a04365c_2448x1574.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Pdu!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d640bb-fca6-480f-a7da-7eaf1a04365c_2448x1574.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Pdu!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d640bb-fca6-480f-a7da-7eaf1a04365c_2448x1574.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Pdu!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d640bb-fca6-480f-a7da-7eaf1a04365c_2448x1574.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>3DBlaster Voodoo2, image from thunder.net</figcaption></figure></div><p>On the 20th of January in 1998, Creative chose to remedy the mistake it had made with their first 3D accelerator, and they released the CT6670, or 3D Blaster Voodoo2. It used the PCI bus, had 8MB of 25ns EDO RAM, and like all Voodoos, supported Glide. In September the same year, the company released the 3D Blaster Voodoo Banshee AGP card (CT6750) as well as the CT6760 PCI card. Depending upon the SKU, these could come with 8MB, 12MB or 16MB of SDRAM. While using the same name, the AGP card was designed entirely by Creative, and it was the only Creative board using a 3dfx chip to be so.</p><p>In July of 1998, Creative proved to be a leader in a different market segment with the introduction of HansVision Future 2000 in schools around Singapore. HVF2K featured the HansWord word processor, the HansBrowser bidirectional English-Chinese dictionary, and the HanSight online translator of webpages. Creative had successfully implemented productivity tools on the web, and they’d done machine translation of the web. Truly outstanding for the time.</p><p>Beginning in 1997, Creative Labs optical drive bundles began featuring DVD drives and speaker sets (thanks to the acquisition of Cambridge SoundWorks), and on the 10th of March in 1998 these products dropped in price rather dramatically and were expanded in their contents. One example, the Creative Components 700 (the most expensive on offer) included Creative’s PC-DVDx2 drive, Sound Blaster AWE64, the new Graphics Blaster Exxtreme (PCI, 3DLabs Permedia 2 chip, 4MB SGRAM, 64bit data path, OpenGL, up to 1600 by 1200, 60Hz to 150Hz refresh), Creative MPEG-2/Dolby Digital decoder board, and Cambridge SoundWorks’ PCWorks speaker system. This was priced at $479.99. The DVD-ROM drive was $149.99 stand-alone, and the decoder board was $169.99 stand-alone.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fpmO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8e64b55-71dc-437c-9d74-35dad83d33b5_1024x890.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fpmO!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8e64b55-71dc-437c-9d74-35dad83d33b5_1024x890.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fpmO!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8e64b55-71dc-437c-9d74-35dad83d33b5_1024x890.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fpmO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8e64b55-71dc-437c-9d74-35dad83d33b5_1024x890.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fpmO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8e64b55-71dc-437c-9d74-35dad83d33b5_1024x890.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fpmO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8e64b55-71dc-437c-9d74-35dad83d33b5_1024x890.jpeg" width="1024" height="890" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8e64b55-71dc-437c-9d74-35dad83d33b5_1024x890.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:890,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fpmO!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8e64b55-71dc-437c-9d74-35dad83d33b5_1024x890.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fpmO!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8e64b55-71dc-437c-9d74-35dad83d33b5_1024x890.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fpmO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8e64b55-71dc-437c-9d74-35dad83d33b5_1024x890.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fpmO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8e64b55-71dc-437c-9d74-35dad83d33b5_1024x890.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Sound Blaster Live!</figcaption></figure></div><p>In August of 1998, Creative released the Sound Blaster Live! (CT4670) as a successor to the ViBRA range of sound cards. These were built around the EMU10K1 chip and supported DirectSound3D, EAX (Environmental Audio Extensions) versions 1 and 2, and featured an onboard, 64-voice, wavetable synthesizer though it did use main memory for sample storage. This was a PCI bus card, and it utilized Ensoniq’s TSR for the emulation of Adlib, Sound Blaster, and General MIDI (the adaptation of that TSR was a condition of the acquisition of Ensoniq).</p><div data-component-name="FileToDOM"><div><p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0Cy0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fattachment_icon.svg"></p><div><p>EMU10K1 Digital Audio Processor</p><p>652KB ∙ PDF file</p></div><p><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/api/v1/file/7bc39fd8-3241-47e5-917a-f29f5e0297f7.pdf" rel=""><span>Download</span></a></p></div><p>EMU10K1 Digital Audio Processor, from IEEE</p><p><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/api/v1/file/7bc39fd8-3241-47e5-917a-f29f5e0297f7.pdf" rel=""><span>Download</span></a></p></div><p>1998 was a year of intense litigation for Creative. The first suit was filed by Creative against Aureal over MIDI caching patent infringements. This was followed by a counter claim of defamation and unfair competition by Aureal against Creative. Creative’s advertising of the Sound Blaster Live! then sparked more lawsuits by Aureal against Creative over claimed falsehoods. By the end of 1999, Aureal had won but had gone bankrupt as a result of legal costs. I am sure it cut quite deeply, but Creative acquired Aureal in September of 2000 for $32 million.</p><p>After 3dfx acquired STB, they began making their own cards. As a result, Creative began making, mostly, Nvidia-based cards for video and graphics. There were some exceptions. The Creative 3D Blaster Savage 4 obviously used the S3 Savage 4 chipset, and the Graphics Blaster Exxtreme used chips from 3DLabs. Possibly to prevent the sort of problem they’d had with 3dfx, Creative then acquired 3DLabs in June of 2002. From 1999 onward, Creative would release a handful of graphics cards, some did well and others didn’t, but they were no longer a substantial source of revenue for the company.</p><div><figure><a

particular product. WinAmp brought MP3 support to the desktop in 1997, and Windows Media Player 5.2 gained MP3 support in 1998. Creative released the NOMAD MP3 player in April of 1999 for $429. In June of 1999, </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-story-of-napster" rel="">Napster</a><span> was born, and MP3s exploded in popularity. The NOMAD connected to a user’s PC via a cradle, and that cradle attached to the PC via parallel port. The device had either 32MB or 64MB of battery backed RAM depending upon the model purchased, with more storage provided by flash media. The NOMAD also provided an FM tuner for those who wished to listen to radio, and a microphone for voice recordings. On the PC side of things, Creative provided both a CD ripper and the NOMAD Manager. The latter of which was for handling the transfer of content to the device. The box proudly claims that 64MB would provide an hour of CD-quality audio, and that’s… well… not true at all. MP3 encoding is quite lossy, and to compress 700MB of lossless CD audio into 64MB infers an incredibly low sample rate. An hour of audio in 64MB would absolutely not be “CD-quality.” Marketing aside, the NOMAD was a cool product.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QCR4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F629aef34-facd-42de-9d57-37fa259c8804_1602x1666.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QCR4!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F629aef34-facd-42de-9d57-37fa259c8804_1602x1666.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QCR4!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F629aef34-facd-42de-9d57-37fa259c8804_1602x1666.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QCR4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F629aef34-facd-42de-9d57-37fa259c8804_1602x1666.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QCR4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F629aef34-facd-42de-9d57-37fa259c8804_1602x1666.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QCR4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F629aef34-facd-42de-9d57-37fa259c8804_1602x1666.png" width="1456" height="1514" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/629aef34-facd-42de-9d57-37fa259c8804_1602x1666.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1514,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1083920,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.abortretry.fail/i/153636346?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F629aef34-facd-42de-9d57-37fa259c8804_1602x1666.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QCR4!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F629aef34-facd-42de-9d57-37fa259c8804_1602x1666.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QCR4!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F629aef34-facd-42de-9d57-37fa259c8804_1602x1666.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QCR4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F629aef34-facd-42de-9d57-37fa259c8804_1602x1666.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QCR4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F629aef34-facd-42de-9d57-37fa259c8804_1602x1666.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>nomadworld.com as of the 9th of October in 1999</figcaption></figure></div><p>The NOMAD II launched the following year, and it was well received by the press.

These also used USB. The II MG returned to the format of the original NOMAD, but it added equalizer presets, ID3-tag support, the wired remote, and the FM tuner returned and now featured. a sleep timer and recording. The NOMAD Jukebox was different. It was roughly the size and shape of a Discman, though slightly thicker, and had a 2.5 inch, 6GB, IDE hard disk in it. The Jukebox also had WAV support, line-in for recording, and two line-out jacks for four speaker systems like Creative’s own Cambridge SoundWorks four point surround. If NiMH batteries were being used, the Jukebox featured a DC jack, and it could charge those batteries. Given the use of spinning rust, battery life was just four hours. For adventurous folks today, the hard disk in this is upgradeable, but the disk didn’t have any identifiable partitions or formatting, and as a result the first 32MB need to be copied with something like </span><code>dd</code><span> and then the drive inserted into the Jukebox and the format function used by holding the Play and Stop buttons (or EAX and Down on newer units) during the “loading” sequence.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9wRR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc41f78f0-c3e7-4e17-bc34-a822f4daeb04_1024x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9wRR!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc41f78f0-c3e7-4e17-bc34-a822f4daeb04_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9wRR!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc41f78f0-c3e7-4e17-bc34-a822f4daeb04_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9wRR!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc41f78f0-c3e7-4e17-bc34-a822f4daeb04_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9wRR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc41f78f0-c3e7-4e17-bc34-a822f4daeb04_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9wRR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc41f78f0-c3e7-4e17-bc34-a822f4daeb04_1024x1024.png" width="1024" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c41f78f0-c3e7-4e17-bc34-a822f4daeb04_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1346035,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.abortretry.fail/i/153636346?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc41f78f0-c3e7-4e17-bc34-a822f4daeb04_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9wRR!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc41f78f0-c3e7-4e17-bc34-a822f4daeb04_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9wRR!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc41f78f0-c3e7-4e17-bc34-a822f4daeb04_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9wRR!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc41f78f0-c3e7-4e17-bc34-a822f4daeb04_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9wRR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc41f78f0-c3e7-4e17-bc34-a822f4daeb04_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Following the 2001 crash, Creative became an increasingly audio-only company.

This patent had been applied for on the 5th of January in 2001. Creative filed suit against Apple in May of 2006, and the two companies reached a settlement in August with Apple agreeing to pay $100 million.</p><p>Time wasn’t kind to Creative. Motherboard audio had become good enough for most people, and fewer than a quarter of desktop users bought dedicated sound cards. Worse, the shift to laptops during the first decade of the new millennium meant that a majority of PC users couldn’t make use of a sound card. Creative voluntarily delisted from the NASDAQ with the last day of trading having been the 31st of August in 2007. The company continued to be listed on SGX-ST. Layoffs of some staff in Stillwater, Oklahoma followed in 2008.</p><p>In 2009, 3DLabs and Creative’s Personal Digital Entertainment divisions were combined and reformed as ZiiLABS. This division designed a series of semi-custom ARM chips with 24 to 96 processing units called StemCells. These StemCells were sort of DSPs, and video, audio, and 3D graphics tasks were handled by these coprocessors. ZiiLABS produced at least five SKUs: ZMS-05, ZMS-08, ZMS-20, ZMS-40, and ZMS-50. On the 19th of November in 2012, Creative announced that they’d licensed ZiiLABS technology and patents to Intel for $20 million, and they sold engineering resources and assets to Intel for $30 million. Creative stated in the announcement that they’d retained the patents themselves. The ZiiLABS website was online through 2023, but it later went dormant with a default tomcat page in 2024, and the domain is no longer active. From 2012 forward, the website hadn’t been updated.</p><p>Today, Creative is led by Freddy Sim (Sim Wong Hoo’s brother), Tan Jok Jin is the executive chairman, and Ng Kai Wa is vice chairman. The company’s 2024 net sales stood at $62.8 million (12% increase over 2023) with $59.4 million of that being due to audio, speakers, and headphones. The company reported a net loss of $11 million for 2024, down from $17 million in 2023. The company continues to sell Sound Blaster products including both internal and external sound cards, DACs, and amplifiers. Their speakers, headphones, and headsets sell well and have won the company some awards.</p><p>Creative rose to dominate the sound card market at a time when there weren’t many options. They made an excellent product, marketed well, and made solid relationships with software makers. The primary issue for the company was that their entire business was built around a single product category, and their attempts to break out of that category weren’t successful. With video cards, they were right on time with a decent product, but the Voodoo was superior. They pivoted and survived that transition only to have 3dfx abandon board partners. They then moved to MP3 players, saw some success, but were beaten by Apple. Today, the company continues in the same niche they once dominated, and they continue to make excellent sound cards. They are simply a much smaller company. Among retro-tech enthusiasts, however, the Sound Blaster 16, Pro, and AWE64 continue to have loyal fans.</p><p><em>My dear readers, many of you worked at, ran, or even founded the companies I cover here on ARF, and some of you were present at those companies for the time periods I cover.

      <h2>Taco Bell AI Drive-Thru - “Hold the AI, Extra Chaos”</h2>

      <!-- Full nominee content sections go here -->
      <div id="details">

            <span>Verified</span>

          <p><strong>Nominee:</strong> Taco Bell Corporation for deploying voice AI ordering systems at 500+ drive-throughs and discovering that artificial intelligence meets its match at “extra sauce, no cilantro, and make it weird.”</p>
          <p><strong>Reported by:</strong> Isabelle Bousquette, Technology Reporter for The Wall Street Journal - August 28, 2025.</p>
          <div><h3>The Innovation</h3><p>Taco Bell boldly deployed voice AI-powered ordering systems across more than 500 drive-through locations, convinced that artificial intelligence could finally solve humanity's greatest challenge: efficiently ordering tacos. The company's confidence was so spectacular that they rolled out the technology at massive scale, apparently believing that voice AI had conquered human speech patterns, regional accents, and the creative chaos that occurs when hungry humans interact with fast food menus.</p></div><div><h3>The Reality Check</h3><p>The Wall Street Journal revealed that customers were not quite as enthusiastic about their robotic taco consultant as Taco Bell had hoped. The AI systems faced a perfect storm of customer complaints, system glitches, and what might charitably be described as “creative user interaction”—including customers deliberately trolling the AI with absurd orders that would make even experienced drive-thru workers question their life choices.</p></div><div><h3>The Strategic Reassessment</h3><p>Faced with mounting evidence that artificial intelligence and natural stupidity don't mix well at the drive-thru window, Taco Bell began “reassessing” their AI deployment. The company announced they were evaluating where AI is most effective and considering human intervention during peak periods—corporate speak for “our robots can't handle the breakfast rush and we're not sure why we thought they could.”</p></div><div><h3>The Perfect Storm</h3><p>This incident represents the collision of three unstoppable forces: corporate AI evangelism, the infinite creativity of hungry customers, and the fundamental reality that ordering food involves more chaos variables than training a large language model to play chess. Customers reported “glitches and delays”, while others were “intent on trolling the [AI] system” with absurd orders, proving that humans can out-weird artificial intelligence even when they're just trying to get a burrito.</p></div><div><h3>Why They're Nominated</h3><p>Taco Bell achieved the perfect AI Darwin Award trifecta: spectacular overconfidence in AI capabilities, deployment at massive scale without adequate testing, and a public admission that their cutting-edge technology was defeated by the simple human desire to customise taco orders. When The Wall Street Journal reports that “the most transformative technology in over a century may have finally found its limit: ordering tacos”, you've achieved a special kind of technological hubris that deserves recognition. Even more remarkably, despite this spectacular AI fail, Taco Bell is reportedly still moving forward with voice AI, which they say remains a critical part of the product road map—proving that true AI confidence means never letting reality interfere with your technological roadmap.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">

        <p>Some people like to spend $3 on a cup of coffee. While that sounds like a gamble I probably wouldn’t take, I’ll always like to gamble– especially as little as three bucks– on what I might be able to dig up on Buffalo and Western New York, our collective past, and what it means for our future.</p>
<p>I recently came across a big pile of Buffalo News front sections from 1991, every day for the first three months of the year… collected as the First Gulf War unfolded. $3. I probably could have chiseled the guy down a buck, but I happily paid to see what else was in those papers.</p>
<p>There’s plenty about a run up to the first Superbowl appearance ever for the Bills, and mixed in with the disappointment is an air of hope and expectation for what is to come. Harumph. There are also some great local ads commemorating and/or coat-tailing on the Bills success.</p>
<p>We’ll get to those someday, but today, something much simpler. The back page of the front section on Saturday, February 16, 1991 was 4/5ths covered with a Radio Shack ad.</p>
<p>There are 15 electronic gimzo type items on this page, being sold from America’s Technology Store. 13 of the 15 you now always have in your pocket.</p>

<p>So here’s the list of what I’ve replaced with my iPhone.</p>
<ul>
<li>All weather personal stereo, $11.88. I now use my iPhone with an Otter Box</li>
<li>AM/FM clock radio, $13.88. iPhone.</li>
<li>In-Ear Stereo Phones, $7.88. Came with iPhone.</li>
<li>Microthin calculator, $4.88. Swipe up on iPhone.</li>
<li>Tandy 1000 TL/3, $1599. I actually owned a Tandy 1000, and I used it for games and word processing. I now do most of both of those things on my phone.</li>
<li>VHS Camcorder, $799. iPhone.</li>
<li>Mobile Cellular Telephone, $199. Obvs.</li>
<li>Mobile CB, $49.95. Ad says “You’ll never drive ‘alone’ again!” iPhone.</li>
<li>20-Memory Speed-Dial phone, $29.95.</li>
<li>Deluxe Portable CD Player, $159.95. 80 minutes of music, or 80 hours of music? iPhone.</li>
<li>10-Channel Desktop Scanner, $99.55. I still have a scanner, but I have a scanner app, too. iPhone.</li>
<li>Easiest-to-Use Phone Answerer, $49.95. iPhone voicemail.</li>
<li>Handheld Cassette Tape Recorder, $29.95. I use the Voice Memo app almost daily.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>tl;dr:</strong>
There's no silver bullet, but if we put some "lead" bullets in the right
places, we have a good shot at keeping sensitive data out of logs.</p><section><br><div><p><img src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/avatar-48p.png" alt="Pixellated avatar"></p><p><em>"This is the blog version of a talk I gave at LocoMocoSec 2024. It’s

many things in security)</em> there isn’t a singular action or silver bullet that
lets you do this. I would go so far as to say that there’s not even an 80/20
rule, where one action fixes 80% of the problem. It’s not like preventing SQL
injection with prepared statements or preventing buffer overflows by using
memory-safe languages.</p><p>What I will offer instead, are lead bullets, of which there are many. I’m going
to talk about 10 of them. They are imperfect and sometimes unreliable things
that, if put in the right places and with defense-in-depth, can still give us a
real good chance at succeeding. My hope is that by the end, you’ll
have a slightly better framework for how to reason about this problem and some
new ideas to add to your kit.</p><p>Table of contents:</p><ul><li><a href="#the-problem">The Problem</a></li><li><a href="#causes">Causes</a><ul><li><a href="#-direct-logging">🤦 Direct logging</a></li><li><a href="#-kitchen-sinks">🚰 Kitchen sinks</a></li><li><a href="#-configuration-changes">🔧 Configuration changes</a></li><li><a href="#-embedded-secrets">🥧 Embedded secrets</a></li><li><a href="#-telemetry">📡 Telemetry</a></li><li><a href="#-user-input">🕺🏻 User input</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#fixes-lead-bullets">Fixes (lead bullets)</a><ul><li><a href="#-data-architecture">📐 Data architecture</a></li><li><a href="#-data-transformations">🍞 Data transformations</a></li><li><a href="#-domain-primitives">🪨 Domain primitives</a><ul><li><a href="#compile-time">Compile-time</a></li><li><a href="#run-time">Run-time</a></li><li><a href="#run-time-part-deux">Run-time: part deux</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#-read-once-objects">🎁 Read-once objects</a></li><li><a href="#-taint-checking">🔎 Taint checking</a><ul><li><a href="#awesome">Awesome</a></li><li><a href="#not-awesome">Not awesome</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#%EF%B8%8F-log-formatters">🗃️ Log formatters</a></li><li><a href="#-unit-tests">🧪 Unit tests</a></li><li><a href="#%EF%B8%8F-sensitive-data-scanners">🕵️ Sensitive data scanners</a><ul><li><a href="#sampling">Sampling</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#-log-pre-processors">🤖 Log pre-processors</a></li><li><a href="#-people">🦸 People</a></li><li><a href="#recap">Recap</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#strategy">Strategy</a><ul><li><a href="#0-lay-the-foundation">0.

secrets in logs.</p><p>So, there are some problems that are annoying. And there are some problems that
are difficult.</p><center><img alt="Meme: two red buttons labeled annoying and difficult being pressed" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/buttons.jpg"></center><p>This is both. I’m gonna level with you: I absolutely hate this problem. But I’m
not going to gaslight you and tell you that this is the most important thing to
work on worry about, because it probably isn’t!</p><p>You have somewhere between 5 and 50 other problems in your backlog that seem
more important, 1 of which you found out about this morning. But I think it’s
likely that none of those problems are nearly as annoying. While researching
this topic, I interviewed about a dozen other engineers and, on this point, they
unanimously agreed! Nobody likes dealing with secrets in logs because it is
extraordinarily <em>annoying</em>.</p><p>This is a problem that’s also difficult, but not even in the fun sense, like
being technically complex or interesting. Once you catch sensitive data in logs,
it’s usually pretty straightforward <em>(at least in retrospect)</em> to determine how
they got there. But, it’s also surprisingly elusive to prevent, and it crops up
in incredibly unexpected places and ways.</p><p>Secrets could mean lots of different things to lots of different teams, but I’ll
use it interchangeably with “sensitive data”: stuff that you want to keep
confidential. What’s <em>so</em> frustrating when breaching confidentiality in logs is
the full spectrum of potential impact.</p><p><img src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/spectrum.jpg" alt="spectrum from “meh” to “oh no”"></p><p>In the best case <em>(left)</em>, you might log an isolated, internal credential, like
an API key, which <em>(kudos!)</em> you rotate right after fixing the source of leak.
The impact is minimal, and you just move on. Of course, all the way on the other
end of the spectrum <em>(right)</em>, you might log something that an attacker or
inside threat could use to do some <em>real harm</em>.</p><p>And then somewhere in-between, where I suspect most of the incidents lie. You
might log secrets that you unfortunately, can’t rotate yourself. Things like PII
or your customer’s passwords, which are reused on other sites, because of course
they are. And, depending on your policies, threat model, or regulations, you
might choose to issue a disclosure or notification.</p><p>And it is painful.</p><center><img alt="a knight in full armor with an arrow labeled LOGS entering the visor" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/knight.jpg"></center><p>You could be doing so many good data security practices, like
secure-by-design frameworks, database and field-level encryption, zero-touch
production, access control… but logging bypasses all of that… and ultimately
degrades trust, in your systems and in your company. It feels unfair because
it’s only a fraction of your security story.</p><p>And this is a problem that happens to companies of all sizes:</p><center><img alt="A screenshot of a Twitter/X blog post in 2018 about log leakage" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/x.jpg"></center><center><img alt="A screenshot of a Google blog post in 2019 about log leakage" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/google.jpg"></center><center><img alt="A screenshot of Krebs on Security in 2019 about Facebook log leakage" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/facebook.jpg"></center><p>Something about “plaintext” just kinda stings, especially as a security
practitioner. It’s like… the most profane insult you can hurl at a security
engineer. Imagine retorting with, <em>“Oh yea? Well, you store your passwords in
plaintext!”</em></p><p>But logging passwords and storing them in plaintext are… kinda the same thing.</p><center><img alt="Meme: same picture" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/samepicture.jpg"></center><p>Because while logs are rarely or purposefully public, they’re typically afforded
broader access than direct access to your databases.</p><p>Everyone knows by now that storing plaintext secrets in your database is a
terrible idea. Logs, however, are still data-at-rest, and we should treat them
with the same level of scrutiny.</p><p>I cherry picked those examples because they are established companies with very
mature security programs. I’m not trying to throw shade; in fact, I deeply
respect them for being public and transparent about this. I think this also
hints that preventing secrets in logs is a deceptively difficult and frustrating
problem.</p><p>If we can understand some causes, we might gain a deeper appreciation for these
past occurrences, and stand a better chance at avoiding new incidents in the
future.</p><h2 id="causes">Causes</h2><p>This is certainly not comprehensive, but from my interviews and personal
experience, here are <strong>six</strong> of the most common causes.</p><ol><li>🤦 <a href="#-direct-logging">Direct logging</a></li><li>🚰 <a href="#-kitchen-sinks">Kitchen sinks</a></li><li>🔧 <a href="#-configuration-changes">Configuration changes</a></li><li>🥧 <a href="#-embedded-secrets">Embedded secrets</a></li><li>📡 <a href="#-telemetry">Telemetry</a></li><li>🕺🏻 <a href="#-user-input">User input</a></li></ol><h3 id="-direct-logging">🤦 Direct logging</h3><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>const</span> <span>temp</span> <span>=</span> <span>res</span>.<span>cookie</span>[<span>"session"</span>];
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>// TODO: remove after testing is done
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>Logger</span>.<span>info</span>(<span>"session HERE"</span>, { <span>temp</span> });
</span></span></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>Narrator: it was <em>not</em> removed after testing was done</p></blockquote><p>The first group is perhaps the most obvious and facepalm one: when sensitive
data is directly logged. Sometimes it’s purely accidental, like the example
above: someone wants to debug session cookies in their local environment and
then… accidentally commits the code. Sometimes it comes from an uninformed
position where the developer just doesn’t know any better.</p><p>These tend to be fairly easy to trace down the exact line of code or commit that
introduces it. With this example, you can just grep the codebase for <code>session here</code> and you’ll find it instantly.</p><h3 id="-kitchen-sinks">🚰 Kitchen sinks</h3><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>const</span> <span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>googleSdk</span>.<span>admin</span>(...);
</span></span><span><span><span>try</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>const</span> <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>client</span>.<span>tokens</span>.<span>list</span>(...);
</span></span><span><span>} <span>catch</span> (<span>e</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>Logger</span>.<span>error</span>(<span>"failed fetch"</span>, { <span>e</span> });
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I’m sure you’ve seen or written code like this before. Here we have an API
client or SDK that is used to fetch some data. Exceptions are caught, kind of,
and then promptly logged so that on-call engineers can debug the errors.</p><p>What happens?</p><center><img alt="Meme: surprise, error handler!" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/surprise.jpg"></center><p>That error is decorated with a config object stuffed with secrets and the full
response object, which is also stuffed with secrets, and now they’re both in
your logs!</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span>{
</span></span><span><span>  <span>e</span><span>:</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>status</span>: <span>400</span>,
</span></span><span><span>    ...
</span></span><span><span>    <span>config</span><span>:</span> { <span>💥☠️🪦</span> },
</span></span><span><span>    <span>response</span><span>:</span> { <span>💣😭😱</span> },
</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I call these “kitchen sinks,” objects that contain or hold secrets, often in
opaque or unexpected ways. Think of an actual kitchen sink that’s filled to the
brim with dirty dishes and you can’t easily tell what’s at the bottom without
reaching into it. Maybe it’s a spoon, or maybe <em>it’s knife and now you have to
go to the hospital</em>. What tends to happen is that the whole kitchen sink gets
logged, and the logging library happily serializes it, including parts that were
actually sensitive.</p><p>This seems to happen with code that attaches additional data onto errors, or
code that logs full request and response objects. It’s typically a bit hard to
catch in code review unless you know to look for them. If you are blessed with
static types, seeing an <code>any</code> type flow into logs can be a good hint that you’re
logging too much.</p><h3 id="-configuration-changes">🔧 Configuration changes</h3><p><img src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/slack.jpg" alt="Slack message of someone trying to lower the log level"></p><blockquote><p>Narrator: it was <em>not</em> okay</p></blockquote><p>Next example: someone needs additional observability and changes a setting like
the global log level. You know exactly what happens, here. This dev is about to
have a bad time and find out that hope, in fact, is not a valid strategy.</p><p>We started with an observability problem. Now we also have security problem: brand
new secrets are getting emitted into logs.</p><p>In that example <em>(that totally never happened to me ever)</em>, developers built
production around log levels set to <code>WARN</code> and above, but once you flip it to
<code>DEBUG</code>, all this new stuff comes out of the woodwork.</p><p>These type of configuration changes tend to involve a system that was built with
one set of assumptions, but some kind of modification moves that system from a
known state into a unknown state, introducing a new set of problems.</p><p>These often involve low-level or global utilities like logging config, HTTP
middleware, or some central piece of infra like a load balancer. They tend to be
singletons that are difficult or costly to test, or they crop up only at
runtime. On the positive side, it’s usually loud and quick to patch, but cleanup
can be kinda painful.</p><h3 id="-embedded-secrets">🥧 Embedded secrets</h3><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>app</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>"/login/:slug"</span>, <span>async</span> (<span>req</span>, <span>res</span>) <span>=&gt;</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>const</span> <span>magicLink</span> <span>=</span> <span>req</span>.<span>params</span>[<span>"slug"</span>];
</span></span><span><span>  <span>await</span> <span>login</span>({ <span>magicLink</span> });
</span></span><span><span>});
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I completely made up this phrase, but the idea is that secrets are coupled to,
embedded into, and <em>baked into</em> more general formats like URLs or remote
procedure calls. The central idea is that it’s designed into the format and the
system, and can’t easily be separated.</p><p>Say you have a magic login link handler (see above) where a user can click a
link and sign into a web app. There’s nothing in that code that logs the link,
but if you look at HTTP logs, it’s right there in plain view:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>47.29.201.179 - - [17/Jul/2024:13:17:10 +0000] "GET /login/Uj79z1pe01...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>These types of leaks arise from fundamental designs that don’t take logging into
consideration or incorrectly assume some end-to-end flow. The sensitivity gets lost out of context, and ends up getting logged in another layer,
system, or service.</p><h3 id="-telemetry">📡 Telemetry</h3><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span>try</span>:
</span></span><span><span>    db_name <span>=</span> os<span>.</span>getenv(<span>"DB_NAME"</span>)
</span></span><span><span>    db_pass <span>=</span> os<span>.</span>getenv(<span>"DB_PASS"</span>) <span># 🤫 Secret!</span>
</span></span><span><span>    conn <span>=</span> db<span>.</span>connect(db_name, db_pass)
</span></span><span><span>    <span>...</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>except</span> Error <span>as</span> e:
</span></span><span><span>    <span># Don't log e! Not today!!11</span>
</span></span><span><span>    Logger<span>.</span>error(<span>"failed to connect"</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>finally</span>:
</span></span><span><span>    conn<span>.</span>close()
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next example: we have some Python code that’s connecting to a database, we’re
specifically NOT logging the error object, and we want to ensure we always close
out the connection.</p><p>How can <code>db_pass</code> possibly make it into logs? Telemetry!</p><center><img alt="A screenshot of a Sentry dashboard" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/sentry.jpg"><br><i>"Oops, that's a log, too!"</i></center><p>It turns out that things like error monitoring and analytics can totally be
logs, too. I kind of cheated in the code example, because there’s no mention of
telemetry in it at all, but it turns out that if you hook it up to error
monitoring like <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> (above), run-time errors send the
local variable context right to the dashboard, and you can see the database
password in plaintext.</p><p>These causes tend to bypass the central logging pipeline and become Yet Another
Place to have to worry about secrets.</p><h3 id="-user-input">🕺🏻 User input</h3><p>Alright, last example. Say there’s a sign in form and the entire dev team made
super duper sure that the password field is totally locked down from logging,
they read this super awesome post, and took care of all the causes we discussed.</p><p>What happens?</p><center><img alt="A screenshot of the AWS sign in form" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/aws.jpg"></center><p>Users end up jamming passwords into the username field!</p><p>So if you ever looked at login alerts for AWS and saw usernames replaced with
<code>HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS</code>, this is precisely why!</p><p>Everything that’s within proximity to sensitive user input tends to be
radioactive. It could be a UI issue, but users are surprisingly determined to
volunteer secrets in ways that you haven’t prepared for.</p><p>We’ve touched on a half dozen causes, and the list of things goes on. We didn’t
even talk about the wonder that is crashdumps. But, I think it’s important to
zoom out and note that these are proximate causes.</p><center><img alt="A funny tweet about root cause" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/root-cause.png"></center><p>I stand by my claim that there’s no silver bullet to take these all out. If we
want to avoid playing whack-a-mole, we must bring out our lead bullets that
address these issues at a deeper level, and prevent these kinds of things from
happening.</p><h2 id="fixes-lead-bullets">Fixes (lead bullets)</h2><p>So let’s dive in! We will survey 10 fixes, and the order we’ll go in is
somewhere between “a dependency graph of things that build on each other” and
“following the lifecycle of a secret.” Some of these are obvious or perhaps
things you’re already doing, so I’ll focus more on fixes that I think might be a
bit newer. That said, it is worth starting with the basics.</p><ol><li>📐 <a href="#-data-architecture">Data architecture</a></li><li>🍞 <a href="#-data-transformations">Data transformations</a></li><li>🪨 <a href="#-domain-primitives">Domain primitives</a></li><li>🎁 <a href="#-read-once-objects">Read-once objects</a></li><li>🗃️ <a href="#-log-formatters">Log formatters</a></li><li>🧪 <a href="#-unit-tests">Unit tests</a></li><li>🕵️ <a href="#-sensitive-data-scanners">Sensitive data scanners</a></li><li>🤖 <a href="#-log-pre-processors">Log pre-processors</a></li><li>🔎 <a href="#-taint-checking">Taint checking</a></li><li>🦸 <a href="#-people">People</a></li></ol><h3 id="-data-architecture">📐 Data architecture</h3><p>Lead bullet #1 is the most basic and high-level: data architecture and
understanding that this is primarily a data flow problem. And part of the
solution is reducing the number of data flows and shrinking the problem space so
you simply have less things to worry about and protect.</p><center><img alt="A simple data architecture flow" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/arch.jpg"></center><p>Instead of stray print statements or components that write directly to
filesystem, you instead centralize all your data flows through a single stream.
Make it so that there’s one and only one way to log something. If you can
understand and control the data structures that enter that funnel, you can
prohibit secrets from exiting it.</p><p>This has the allure of being a silver bullet, because of course if you can get
to 100% of all the things we mentioned here, you’re golden! But in practice (and
as we’ve seen previously), that’s difficult because secrets find a way to sneak
in or new outflows and side channels are created.</p><h3 id="-data-transformations">🍞 Data transformations</h3><p>The previous bullet was about controlling how data flows through your system,
this is about transforming, slicing, and disarming that data into safer forms
that can be logged. These are the data security fundamentals that you’re already
familiar with and likely already doing. This is your bread and butter, so I’m
not going to dive into every one. From top to bottom, this is generally arranged
from awesome to meh… basically, by how much information is retained.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Transformation</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Minimization</td><td>☁ (nothing)</td></tr><tr><td>Redaction</td><td>[redacted]</td></tr><tr><td>Tokenization</td><td>2706a40d-3d1d…</td></tr><tr><td>Hashing</td><td>daadfab322b59…</td></tr><tr><td>Encryption</td><td>AzKt7vBE7qEuf…</td></tr><tr><td>Masking</td><td>··········<code>5309</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>On the top, we have data minimization. The best way to not log secrets, is to
not have secrets to begin with! This is everything from going passwordless to
fetching only the data you need.</p><p>Redaction is the next best thing. Blanking out the secret parts and before you pass
objects around in memory.</p><p>Tokenization, hashing, encryption: these all have their pros, cons, and caveats.
Like… are you even doing it correctly?</p><p>Dead last is masking. You leave parts of the secret intact. Maybe this works for you.
Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe you go straight to jail 🤷</p><p>When these techniques work, they generally work well. But very often what
happens is that they aren’t used or are used too late, after something is
already logged. These have their places in our toolbox, but my claim again is
one bullet isn’t enough.</p><h3 id="-domain-primitives">🪨 Domain primitives</h3><p>Let’s introduce lead bullet #3: domain primitives. Almost all the secrets you
run across in codebases are encoded in-memory as string primitives, and I think
that makes our jobs harder. Strings can be almost anything.</p><blockquote><p>Strings: any sequence of bytes from <code>""</code> to <code>"c̴̞̑ť̸͈̘̌ h̸͝ ̭̘̊ü̶̜̫̦̠͋̆͠ ļ̵̮̤̟̉̀͂ṹ̴̝̂🤷867-53-0999"</code></p></blockquote><p>There’s very little about them——at compile time or run-time——that lets you
know that it’s sensitive, dangerous to log, or somehow different than any other
vanilla string.</p><p>The alternative is a concept I learned from the book <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/secure-by-design">Secure by
Design</a>, and I think it’s one of
the most powerful concepts you can add to your codebase, for logs or anything
else where you want to layer in security at a fundamental level.</p><blockquote><p>Domain primitives: “combines secure constructs and value objects to define the
smallest building block of a <strong>domain</strong>”</p></blockquote><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gdscript3"><span><span><span>const</span> secret <span>=</span> new Secret(<span>"..."</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You use them as basic building blocks that hold secret values, and they provide

to focus on the implementation or even TypeScript, for that matter. The salient
point here is that instead of tossing secret strings around, you brand them as
secret types, providing useful context to both compiler and developer.</p><h4 id="run-time">Run-time</h4><p>It’s really easy to get started, even with code that is functionally a no-op.
This is basically the simplest form I can think of—an almost empty
class:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>class</span> <span>OpenAIToken</span> <span>extends</span> String { <span>/* that could be it! */</span> }
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>const</span> <span>token</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>OpenAIToken</span>(...);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It’s supposed to represent OpenAI credentials, but it’s just using and extending
basic language primitives. You can introduce these objects where secrets
originate, like password fields or anytime you decrypt sensitive data fetched
from the database. And then layer in behaviors and invariants for where they
tend to end up. You progressively start introducing these at both sources and
sinks, allowing you to control where secrets should or shouldn’t go. You can
embed these into data structures so you know what contains secrets. And along
the way, you increase the clarity and safety of your codebase: not only can you
prevent these tokens from going into logs, you can make sure you’re sending them
only to OpenAI and not to some other API by accident.</p><p>I think in the long run, domain primitives are the most powerful control we have
because it makes our code <em>secure by design</em>, but it does take some time to get
there. These can easily address the direct logging cause we discussed earlier,
and with some modifications can help with many more.</p><h4 id="run-time-part-deux">Run-time: part deux</h4><p>We can extend this and make it so that the default serialization behavior is
redaction.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>class</span> <span>Secret</span> <span>extends</span> String {

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There’s so many things you can do here, like maybe you want to encrypt or zero it out
in memory, because that’s in your threat model. You can take this as far as you need
to or are comfortable with. We’ll take it just one step further.</p><h3 id="-read-once-objects">🎁 Read-once objects</h3><p>There’s a bit to unpack here, but these build off domain primitives in a very
powerful way.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>class</span> <span>Secret</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt; {

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>These objects wrap and keep the secret safe, until you actually
need it. The code in the <code>unwrap()</code> function is the crux: there’s a latch or
lock that activates after the secret is retrieved the first time. It goes into a
“locked” state, and any following reads result in an error that fails loudly.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>const</span> <span>secret</span> <span>=</span> <span>getSecret</span>();

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once you get a secret <em>(from user input, database, decryption, etc.)</em> you wrap
it in a read-once object immediately and keep it wrapped for as long as you can.
And for its single, intended purpose, like using it for some kind of API
authentication, you unwrap the value, use it, and then the object stays locked
for good. This is surprisingly effective at preventing and detecting
unintentional use. It addresses and disarms many of the proximate causes that we
discussed earlier.</p><p>This object pairs extremely well with static analysis. Tools like CodeQL or
Semgrep can help ensure that developers aren’t bypassing any safety guarantees.</p><p>These are generally high signal, especially when you have good unit test
coverage. One drawback is that read-once objects, if handled incorrectly but not
necessarily unsafely, could cause errors at run-time. But I think the tradeoffs
are usually worth it, especially if you complement it with testing, static
analysis, and taint-checking. <em>Speaking of which…</em></p><h3 id="-taint-checking">🔎 Taint checking</h3><p>I like to think of taint checking as static analysis with superpowers. I
absolutely love it and the first time I used it, it was like someone just handed
me a lightsaber. Quick review for the uninitiated: the general idea here is that
you add taint to various sources (like database objects), and yell loudly if the
data flows into certain sinks (like logs).</p><center><img alt="A simple taint flow diagram" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/simple-taint.jpg"></center><p>The red data flow trace on the right detects the secret flowing into logs. But
the green path is fine, because the secret is tokenized. Let’s walk through a
quick example:
<a href="https://semgrep.dev/playground/s/4bq5L">semgrep.dev/playground/s/4bq5L</a></p><p><img src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/semgrep.jpg" alt="An annotated screenshot from Semgrep"></p><p>On the left, we’ve marked a couple sources like decrypt and a database fetcher.
We’ve also marked our logger as a sink, and the <code>tokenize()</code> function as a
sanitizer.</p><ul><li>On the right in red, we can see that taint was created from the decrypt
function, propagated through the <code>getSSN()</code> function, and then flagged for
going into the logs on line 18.</li><li>In blue, there’s a much shorter path where the user model from the database is
tainted and then flagged for going into logs.</li><li>And then lastly, in green, we’re tokenizing the decrypted SSN, so it’s not
flagging that it’s logged.</li></ul><p>The idea that this is checking <em>millions</em> or more different data flows is the
real magic part for me.</p><h4 id="awesome">Awesome</h4><p>Some of the strengths of taint analysis: obviously automation. Tracing these
data flows is 100% a job for a machine. This can really help with domain
primitives but also can be used standalone and can even key in on heuristics
like variable names: for example, all variables containing “password”. You can
tie this into all of your critical tools, from code review to CI/CD.</p><p>This is especially potent against kitchen sinks and embedded secrets, because
those data structures can be tainted by secret values and checked accordingly.</p><h4 id="not-awesome">Not awesome</h4><p>Some personal opinions on drawbacks: I do feel like taint checking rules tend to
be a bit difficult to write. I really, really like Semgrep, but I’m also not the
biggest fan of YAML.</p><p>It also turns out that data flow analysis is an NP-hard problem so for large
codebases and monorepos, you likely can’t run full taint analysis on every pull
request or commit. Because it runs in CI/CD and as part of change management,
when it works, it can prevent the introduction of insecure logging into the
codebase.</p><p>But, like all of the lead bullets we’ve discussed and will discuss, they can
miss. How can we handle that?</p><h3 id="-log-formatters">🗃️ Log formatters</h3><p>Let’s say we made the mistake of logging too much data with our email service:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span>{

described previously, like request headers or config objects. I’ve used this
with decent success and found that it works best as a rifle instead of a
shotgun. Because it’s at the application tier, you can customize it for the type
of data or context that each application handles. For example, we can make it so
that any of our domain primitives that reach this layer are quickly detected and
removed.</p><p>This is extremely cheap to introduce, but there are some trade-offs. It’s
certainly more of a safety net than hard control, and a developer determined to
bypass it, can and will. Steady state, I measured this at less than 1% of clock
time, but there are some deeply unfortunate ways this can go wrong such as
poorly written regexes and self-ReDoS.</p><p>More or less, these risks can be mitigated with solid unit-testing. Which leads
us to…</p><h3 id="-unit-tests">🧪 Unit tests</h3><p>Lead bullet #7: hooking into and using the existing test suite—that’s already
there—to our advantage. We can use several of the tools we discussed, but
instead of simply detecting or redacting secrets, we can ramp up the sensitivity
in our test environment to fail or error loudly.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Technique</th><th>Prod</th><th>Test</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>🪨 Domain primitives</td><td>Redact</td><td>Error</td></tr><tr><td>🎁 Read-once objects</td><td>Error</td><td>Error</td></tr><tr><td>🗃️ Log formatters</td><td>Redact</td><td>Error</td></tr><tr><td>🕵️ Sensitive data scanners</td><td>Detect</td><td>Error</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I’ll cover sensitive data scanners next, but many test suites are already set up
to capture <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>, and so you can even point your scanners to
these capture buffers.</p><p>The takeaway here is that you can reap the same benefits of CI/CD and change
management by catching unsafe code before it’s merged or deployed, but of
course, you’re also dependent on coverage and if the right code and data paths
are exercised.</p><h3 id="-sensitive-data-scanners">🕵️ Sensitive data scanners</h3><p>These are fairly blunt but effective tools that can discover and remove
sensitive data. I’m actively going to avoid diving deep here, because it does
seem like many teams and vendors focus on this as the solution. So instead, I’d
like to pose a few questions that might help you reason about trade-offs:</p><ul><li>Where and when in your logging pipeline is it most effective?</li><li>Is it a gate, in-line of the critical path, or does it scan asynchronously?</li><li>Do you simply want to detect or do you bias towards masking and
redaction? How will your team handle and deal with false positives?</li><li>How far do the general, out-of-box rules take you? Can you tailor it
specifically to your usage patterns?</li><li>Can you verify the credentials? Can that even keep up with log throughput?</li><li>And then perhaps what tends to be the long pole in the tent: what are the
costs, and can you sample instead?</li></ul><p>I think these tools tend to be better suited for defense-in-depth, because
they presume that secrets made it into logs to begin with. They can help catch the
more elusive causes we discussed like configuration changes or user input.</p><h4 id="sampling">Sampling</h4><p>A very brief segue into sampling. Logs tend to have a kind of power law
distribution, where certain types of logs vastly outnumber others. And typically
what you see is that log sources have static points in code, generally with the
same type of data running through them. And so within each log type, scanning
and finding a single true positive might be highly representative of that group.</p><p>And so you might run into a scenario where, given some global sample rate,
you’re wasting a lot of work for high frequency logs and not even scanning lower
frequency logs. I think a better alternative to a global sample rate is to
aggregate logs by some heuristic like type or origin, and to ensure you hit some
minimum threshold.</p><center><img alt="A chart depicting sampling" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/sampling.jpg"></center><p>In practice, I’ve found this difficult or impossible to configure with
out-of-box solutions. I’ve had to introduce additional infrastructure to help.
And that’s our next lead bullet.</p><h3 id="-log-pre-processors">🤖 Log pre-processors</h3><p>Second to last lead bullet, #9: log pre-processors. These sit between apps that
emit logs, and the final data stores.</p><center><img alt="A simple architecture diagram" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/preprocessing.jpg"></center><p>In the above example, something like <a href="https://vector.dev/">Vector</a> can receive
and process logs from our microservices before dispatching them to DataDog or
wherever logs end up. We can configure it to drop sensitive data in-place using
many of the techniques we discussed before. And we can sample some subset of
them and store them onto an S3 bucket, using a more powerful tool like
<a href="https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog">Trufflehog</a> or an LLM to catch
and verify secrets.</p><p>The idea here is to process logs streams before they’re persisted. It doesn’t
need to be Vector, chances are, you already have this existing infrastructure
that’s used for deduping, aggregation, and dropping noisy debug logs. We can
re-use it to prevent and detect secrets in logs. This pairs very well with
sensitive data scanners that we discussed earlier, and might even unlock new
ones you thought were out of reach.</p><h3 id="-people">🦸 People</h3><blockquote><p>“Human practitioners are the adaptable element of complex systems.
Practitioners and first line management actively adapt the system to maximize

will write the code that accidentally introduces sensitive data into logs,
they’re also the ones that will report, respond, and fix them. They’ll build out
the systems and infrastructure that will keep these complex systems safe. And
early on in your maturity story and before you’re able to build out
secure-by-design frameworks, this is the lead bullet you’ll most likely use the
most.</p><p>The most important message I want to convey here is that your security team isn’t
alone, especially if you:</p><ul><li>educate your teammates on secure logging design</li><li>empower them to report and address these issues</li><li>and equip them with tools that get out of their way and helps them succeed.</li></ul><h3 id="recap">Recap</h3><p>Alright, so we’ve covered lead bullets that protect code, protect data, and
protect logs:</p><ol><li>📐 Data architecture</li><li>🍞 Data transformations</li><li>🪨 Domain primitives</li><li>🎁 Read-once objects</li><li>🗃️ Log formatters</li><li>🧪 Unit tests</li><li>🕵️ Sensitive data scanners</li><li>🤖 Log pre-processors</li><li>🔎 Taint checking</li><li>🦸 People</li></ol><p>Some of these might work for you, some of these won’t, and some that we haven’t
even mentioned could be a homerun for you. Maybe you have super tight control
over your log schemas or maybe you’re using LLMs in a really neat and effective
way. Or maybe you’re building or using a language that has first class support
for controlling secrets.</p><p>These worked for me. I have some personal opinions on ones which are
foundational, some that are powerful in the long-run, and some that are really
easy to get started. But your story is different, so I’d like to zoom
out and close out with a high-level, methodical strategy that you can apply for
your security programs, and that we’ll apply and walk through with an example.</p><h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2><p>Here’s <em>a</em> general strategy:</p><ol start="0"><li>Lay the foundation</li><li>Understand the data ﬂow</li><li>Protect at chokepoints</li><li>Apply defense-in-depth</li><li>Plan for response and recovery</li></ol><p>I’m not shooting for a Nobel, here. You’re probably doing some of these already,
and chances are, you have some type of playbook or process that looks just like
this. The key idea here is to not miss the forest for the trees, and use these
explicit steps to place our efforts where they’ll matter most. I’ll walk you
through a hypothetical system and we’ll apply these in order.</p><h3 id="0-lay-the-foundation">0. Lay the foundation</h3><p>Step zero is the foundation. Table stakes. This is like the base tier of
Maslow’s hierarchy, and we need these before we try anything else.</p><p>Developing expectations, culture, and support is a must-have. They’re easy to
ignore or forget about, but can make or break success. If you work at place that
hasn’t addressed these in the past, it can be quite jarring or difficult to
shift that mentality.</p><center><img alt="Meme: high-fiving a drowning hand" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/high-five.jpg"></center><p>I don’t have a ton of advice here other than making sure your org is aligned on
this. It’ll probably feel like it’s getting worse before it’s getting better,
but that is a sign of progress. A great litmus test for a solid foundation is if
developers will (or already have) come to you to report secrets they found in
logs.</p><p>The second thing we’ll need is to decide is what we consider a secret to begin
with. I, admittedly, used secrets and sensitive data interchangeably. This may
not be the case for you. It doesn’t need to be perfect or comprehensive, and
maybe it’s just a framework. But employees, especially the security team, need
common understanding.</p><p>The third item is technical. If our logs aren’t structured or aren’t JSON, it’ll
make this endeavor a lot more difficult. A lot of the techniques we discussed
just won’t work. If we don’t have that central pipeline or there isn’t <em>One and
Only One Way</em> to both dispatch and view logs, we’ll have to do a lot more
lifting. We’ve seen a few ways that logs bypass this, but having a central
pipeline should cover most of the bases.</p><h3 id="1-understand-the-data-flow">1. Understand the data flow</h3><p>With the foundation laid, the next best thing to do is to understand and chart
out how secrets flow through your system. This is basically a Data Flow Diagram,
and we’ll go through a fairly modest example.</p><center><img alt="A data flow diagram" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/dfd.jpg"></center><p>On the left, we have users that visit some type of single-page web app. Requests
and data flow through an application load balancer to several web application
services running in containers. This is our core compute and where all the
application code runs. Let’s assume that these are disparate microservices
processing all types of data, some of which are considered secret. For the most
sensitive data, they use KMS to encrypt and then store the ciphertext blobs in
their respective database.</p><p>And then, applications use a standard logging library to emit to stdout, which
gets shipped to CloudWatch and then forwarded to Datadog. That’s the final stop,
and that’s where employees, devs, support staff, etc. can view them.</p><p>I highly recommend going through an exercise like this, because not only does it
force you to understand the flows and boundaries of the system, if you spend
time at each node and threat model it, you end up finding a bunch of unexpected
ways and places that secrets make it into logs. For example…</p><ul><li>Front-end analytics! It turns out that secrets from things like form contents
to session replays could end up getting sent to your user analytics platform.</li><li>And then what about our application load balancers? These ship their HTTP logs
directly to CloudWatch, so we could be logging embedded secrets in URLs, and
it’s totally bypassing our application tiers.</li><li>Last surprise: error monitoring! Let’s just say that some team wired up Sentry
instead of DataDog for error monitoring, <em>because of course they did</em>, and now
you have another stream of secrets in logs.</li></ul><center><img alt="An animated DFD with new flows" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/dfd.gif"></center><p>We could go further, and we haven’t even drilled into application architecture,
but I think this is a good time to move from discovery to action.</p><h3 id="2-protect-at-chokepoints">2. Protect at chokepoints</h3><p>The next step we want to take is to protect the chokepoints. And if some flow
isn’t going through that chokepoint, like our rogue team that <em>yeeted</em> Sentry
into prod, we fix it! We can get rid of Sentry and get that team onto the paved
path of our logging pipeline.</p><p>We have a very clear chokepoint; a narrow path that most logs eventually flow
through. Here’s where most of our lead bullets should go.</p><center><img alt="Horziontally-aligned chokepoint" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/chokepoint1.jpg"></center><p>Here’s that chokepoint splayed out. I also added an upstream node to represent
CI/CD, because that’s how code get into our apps. We can then put the bulk of
our protective controls here on the critical path.</p><p>We can re-architect the app to use a single logging library and
secure-by-default domain primitives. Then we could use those to build out and
augment our static analysis, taint-checking, and unit tests. These give us a
decent front-line defense for our logging pipeline.</p><h3 id="3-apply-defense-in-depth">3. Apply defense-in-depth</h3><blockquote><p>“Every preventative control should have a detective control at the same level
and/or one level downstream in the architecture.”
-<em>Phil Venables, <a href="https://www.philvenables.com/post/defense-in-depth">https://www.philvenables.com/post/defense-in-depth</a></em></p></blockquote><p>The third step is about adding depth to that defense, a concept we’re all
familiar with. I really like how Phil Venables crystallizes what
defense-in-depth means and I think he generally gives great advice. The idea is
that our controls are not simply overlapping, but mutually supportive.
Something’s always got your back.</p><p>Along this chokepoint we add our downstream components, in depth. Some are
preventative, while some are detective.</p><center><img alt="Horziontally-aligned chokepoint" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/chokepoint2.jpg"></center><p>We can add additional protections like tokenization and read-once objects. We
can add the downstream tools like our custom log formatters, and employ various
sensitive data scanners at different points. And then finally, we can educate
and equip our team.</p><p>This is what defense-in-depth looks like to me, and I think this maximizes
chances of success.</p><h3 id="4-plan-for-response-and-recovery">4. Plan for response and recovery</h3><ul><li>Determine the scope</li><li>Restrict access</li><li>Stop the bleeding / ﬁx the source</li><li>Clean up all the places, e.g. indexes</li><li>Restore access</li><li>Do a post-mortem</li><li>Make it ~impossible to happen again</li></ul><p>But, of course, if we do miss or if we manage to only detect vs. prevent, we
should be prepared for response and recovery. You already know how to respond to
incidents like this, so I won’t add much here, other than making sure you’re
sticking to a playbook in the right order, pulling levers to restrict and
restore access while you’re responding, as well as thinking about all the weird
places secrets might persist in logs, like indexes.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>And that’s it. This is the culmination of our strategy, our work, and about 30
some minutes of blabber.</p><center><img alt="Overlaid DFD w/ controls" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/final.jpg"></center><p>With a solid foundation and understanding of our data
flows, we protected our chokepoints in-depth and kept secrets out of logs. We’ve
also introduced a lot of other strong primitives that materially improve our
security program. So is that it? Is the job done?</p><p>Well, no, because the data team wired up some ETL jobs that are now spewing
secrets into data lake logs, <em>because of course they did</em>.</p><center><img alt="Animated DFD with new data flow" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/final.gif"></center><p>Like most things in security, the job often isn’t ever done. But we have the
understanding, the tools, and a strategy to fight the next fight. Keeping
secrets out of logs is in <em>your hands</em>.</p><center><img alt="Comedian pretending he has no hands" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/no-hands.gif"><br><i>*me</i></center><p>If you liked what you heard, or if you hated it, I’d love to hear your story.
Please, <a href="https://allan.reyes.sh/about/">reach out</a>! Thanks! ✌️</p></section></div>]]></description>

<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>

<p>
SQLite is a TCL extension that has escaped into the wild.


</p><p>
The design of SQLite was inspired by the design of TCL, both in
the way it handles datatypes and in the formatting of its source
code.
The index use case for SQLite was in a Tcl/Tk application for an
industrial company.
From its inception, SQLite has always depended heavily on TCL.
These days, SQLite no longer uses TCL internally and can be run
separately from any TCL interpreter, and yet the SQLite development
process still depends heavily on TCL.
</p>

<h3>1.1 About SQLite</h3>

<p>
SQLite is an SQL database engine, and 
the most widely used database engine in the world.
SQLite is built into all cellphones as a core component and is the
primary means of data persistence on phones.  SQLite is also an
integral part of most web browsers.  SQLite is built into MacOS and
is used by most of the default applications on that platform.
Windows10 requires the C:\Windows\System32\winsqlite3.dll file in
order to boot.  Countless other popular applications like Skype 
and WhatsApp and iTunes depend on SQLite.

</p><p>
Because SQLite is open source and can be freely downloaded and
duplicated, exact usage numbers are unavailable.  But reasonable
estimates are that there are more SQLite instances in operation
today than there are people on earth.  Most devices that
use the SQLite database engine contain hundreds of separate databases,
and there are billions of such devices.  Hence, there are likely
around one trillion SQLite databases in active use.

</p><p>
There are more copies of SQLite in use than there are copies of Linux.
We know this because SQLite is used on almost all Linux systems, but
SQLite is also used on many other non-linux systems such as Macs, iPhones,
and Windows computers.
By similar arguments, there are more copies of SQLite in use than
there are Macs, or Windows PCs.
There are probably more copies of SQLite in use than all other database
engines combined.
It seems likely that SQLite is the most widely used and deployed
software component of any kind, with the possible exception of the
zLib compression library.

</p><h3>1.2 SQLite Is A TCL Extension, Not A TCL Application</h3>

<p>
SQLite is not written in TCL.  Rather, SQLite is intended to be used
by TCL.  Like the TCL interpreter, SQLite is written in ANSI C.

</p><p>
The fact that SQLite was primarily intended to be used from TCL
is evident in an number of ways.

</p><p>
All programming languages, other than C/C++, require some kind of
adaptor in order to interface with the SQLite C implementation.  Language
adaptors for SQLite are widely available from third party programmers.
The adaptors for PHP and Python are built into those languages, for
example.  A Java adaptor is baked into Android.  And so forth.  Only
the TCL adaptor is included as part of the SQLite core.  The source code
file that implements the TCL adaptor for SQLite, "tclsqlite.c",
was part of the very first check-in on the SQLite source repository
on 2000-05-29.  (See 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/ci/6f3655f79f9b6fc9">https://sqlite.org/src/ci/6f3655f79f9b6fc9</a>.)

</p><p>
All modern SQL implementations provide a means to do late binding of
parameter values to the SQL statements.  Usually a naked "?" character,
or a "?" followed by an integer is used.  For example:

</p><blockquote><pre>SELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=<b>?1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The "?1" token in the SQL above would be assigned a value at run-time
in order to look up the password and photograph of a particular user.

</p><p>
SQLite supports this syntax.  But because of its TCL heritage, SQLite
also allows the parameter to take the form of a TCL variable.  Hence:

</p><blockquote><pre>SELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=<b>$uid</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
When a statement such as the above is run, the TCL language adaptor
automatically binds the value of the $uid TCL variable to the SQL statement
before it is evaluated, providing an intuitive and seamless interface
between TCL and SQL.  SQLite is the only database engine that behaves
this way.

</p><p>
The TCL heritage of SQLite is visible in the type system of
SQLite.  Early versions of SQLite (prior to 2004) operated on the classic
TCL principal that "everything is a string".  Beginning with SQLite3
(2004-06-18), SQLite also supports binary data.  However, types are still
very flexible in SQLite, just as they are in TCL.  SQLite treats the datatypes
on column names in a CREATE TABLE statement as suggestions rather than
hard requirements.  SQLite is happy to store a 100KB string value in a
column that is declared "SHORT INT", just as TCL is happy to store either
a large string or a small integer in the same variable.  There are some
differences in how SQLite deals with datatypes, in comparison to TCL, due
to the different nature of the SQL language.  SQLite has the concept of
"type affinity".  If a column is declared "INT" and one inserts a string
into that column that looks like an integer and can be safely converted into
an integer without loss of information, then that conversion occurs
automatically.  This provides a measure of compatibility with the rigid
type systems of other SQL database engines.

</p><p>
The flexible type system of SQLite seems natural and intuitive to programmers
with prior experience programming in TCL.  Curiously, though, it is a source
of frustration and frequent complaining from programmers accustomed to the
rigid and unforgiving type systems of languages like Java.

</p><p>
The similarities in the type systems of TCL and SQLite extends to more than
just the interface.  An important part of the C/C++ interface for SQLite
is the "sqlite3_value" object
(<a href="https://sqlite.org/c3ref/value.html">https://sqlite.org/c3ref/value.html</a>) which is analogous to the
Tcl_Obj object in TCL.  Both TCL and SQLite use a dual-representation approach,
where each value can be represented simultaneously as both a string and
some other type.

</p><h2>2.0 How SQLite Depends On Tcl</h2>

<p>
SQLite began as a TCL extension, though these days most uses of SQLite
are in applications written in languages other than TCL.  Many programmers
who use SQLite in their applications have no knowledge or awareness of TCL.
The SQLite source code used by most developers is a single file of pure
C code named "sqlite3.c" that contains no TCL code.  
This is what we mean when we
say that SQLite as "escaped" into the wild.  Deployed instances of SQLite
no longer depends on TCL.

</p><p>
Nevertheless, SQLite is still heavily dependent upon TCL and the ongoing
support, maintenance, and enhancement of SQLite would not be possible without
TCL, and would be seriously inconvenienced without Tk.


</p><h3>2.1 SQLite Source Code Is Mostly TCL</h3>

<p>
The deliverable source code for SQLite is a single file named
"sqlite3.c" and its companion header "sqlite3.h".
Both files are 100% ANSI-C code.  But developers do not edit these
files directly.  The sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h source files are build
products, and the source tree used to build those files is over 50%
TCL code.  Figure 1 nearby shows the exact ratios.

<b>Figure 1: Breakdown Of SQLite Source Code By Language</b>
</center>

<p>
Figure 1 is for the main SQLite source repository.  Many of the test
cases and much of the documentation is held in separate repositories,
not included in Figure 1.  The separate repositories also contain a great
deal of TCL code.

</p><p>
Much of the TCL code in the main SQLite repository consists of test scripts.
At this writing, the core repository contains 1153 separate test scripts
totally about 389 KB of space.
But this is not the only use of TCL in SQLite.

</p><h3>2.2 Machine Generated C Code</h3>

<p>
A non-trivial amount of the deliverable C code for SQLite is machine
generated.  Some of the machine generated code is created by C programs,
such as LEMON which translates the SQL language grammar into C code to
implement a push-down automaton to parse the SQL language.  But much of
the automatically generated code is created using TCL scripts.  TCL is
well suited for scanning source files to extract information to be
merged with other files and for making mechanized edits.  For example,
the byte-code engine used to evaluate SQL statements inside of SQLite
is implemented as a large "switch" statement inside a "for" loop, with a
separate "case" for each opcode, all in the "vdbe.c" source file.
At build-time, TCL scripts scan the vdbe.c source file looking for the
appropriate "case" statements and then build header files that assign
consecutive integers to each symbolic opcode name.  (The opcodes used by
the SQLite byte-code engine are not an API as they are in TCL and thus
can change from one build to the next.)  This mapping of symbolic opcode
names into integers is not a simple as one might suppose.  For reasons
of optimization, there are many constraints on the specific values that
are assigned to opcodes.  For example, many opcodes such as OP_Add must
have the same numeric value as the corresponding "+" token in the SQL
language parser.  Sometimes a group of related opcodes, such as the
comparison operators OP_Eq, OP_Ne, OP_Lt, OP_Le, OP_Ge, and OP_Gt, need
to be assigned consecutive integers in a specific order.  These constraints
are all handled effortlessly in TCL.  Accomplishing the
same with AWK would be rather more difficult.

</p><p>
Perhaps the most important task for TCL during the SQLite build process
is constructing the SQLite amalgamation source code file.
Recall that most developers use SQLite in the form of a single big file
of C code named "sqlite3.c" and referred to as "the amalgamation".
A TCL script named "mksqlite3c.tcl" runs in order to construct the
amalgamation from over one hundred separate input files.  Each of these
inputs files must be added to the amalgamation in just the right order.
Furthermore, the source files are edited as part of the amalgamation building
process.  When mksqlite3c.tcl encounters a "#include" for an SQLite header,
it replaces the "#include" with a copy of that header file, taking care
to make sure each header file is only included once.  The mksqlite3.tcl
script automatically adds the "static" keyword to internal SQLite APIs
to give them file linkage, and makes other similar edits.

</p><h3>2.3 The sqlite3_analyzer.exe Utility</h3>

<p>
In addition to the core SQLite library, the SQLite source tree also contains
code for several analysis and control programs.  One of these programs
is called "sqlite3_analyzer" (or "sqlite3_analyzer.exe" on Windows).
The sqlite3_analyzer program examines an SQLite database and generates
a detailed report on the disk usage by the various tables and indexes
within that database.  The sqlite3_analyzer program is very useful in
understanding how an application is using disk space.

</p><p>
It turns out that sqlite3_analyzer, though disguised as an ordinary
executable, is really a TCL application.  The main source code file for
this application is
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/file/tool/spaceanal.tcl">tool/spaceanal.tcl</a>.
During the build process, this script is converted into a C-language
string constant (using another TCL script) and added to a very simple
C-language wrapper than starts a TCL interpreter and then passes the
application script to that interpreter.

</p><p>
The sqlite3_analyzer program could be rewritten in pure C.  But that
would be a lot of code.  The TCL script that implements sqlite3_analyzer is
less than 1000 lines long.  The equivalent C program would surely be at
least ten times larger.

</p><p>
Note that the sqlite3_analyzer utility program statically links a TCL
interpreter and so does not require a TCL installation on the target
computer to use.  The sqlite3_analyzer utility program is used by
tens of thousands of developers, most of whom do not realize that they
are really running a TCL application.

</p><h3>2.4 TCL Used For Testing SQLite</h3>

<p>
One of the key features of SQLite is that it uses aviation-grade testing.
The tests of SQLite, at a minimum, provide 100% modified condition/decision
coverage (MC/DC) of the SQLite code, with independence.  100% MC/DC roughly
means that every branch instruction at the machine code level is exercised
at least once in each direction.  The precise definition of
MC/DC is slightly stricter than this, for example when comparing boolean
vectors, but the 100% branch tests coverage definition is very close
approximation.  The "with independence" term means that SQLite is tested
in multiple ways with test code being written and maintained by different
individuals.

</p><p>
The amount of testing done on SQLite is fanatical.  On the other hand,
that level of testing is necessary for a fundamental low-level component,
such as a database engine, that is used by billions of devices.  If an
ordinary application encounters an obscure bug, it can normally be rebooted 
to clear the problem.  But the job of a database engine is to remember things,
and so databases tend to remember their mistakes across reboots.  For these
reasons, it is important that SQLite have a very low bug density.

</p><p>
TCL is used in every aspect of SQLite testing.
The test cases that are part of the primary SQLite source code
repository are written in TCL.
Other test cases such as 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/th3.html">TH3</a> and
<a href="https://sqlite.org/sqllogictest">SQLLogicTest</a> are written
in C but still depend on TCL for operation.

</p><p>
The TH3 test suite is a set of proprietary tests for SQLite that form the
primary means of achieving 100% MC/DC.  TH3 is designed to
run on embedded hardware without the support of a desktop operating system.
TH3 consists of over 1350 test modules together with over 100 control files.
The test modules are written in either C or SQL or a combination of both.
The control files are text formatted in a way that easily parsed by TCL.
To build a TH3 test, a TCL script is run that combines some subset of the
test modules and control files into a single large C program that will
automatically run the required tests.  This C program is then linked against
the "sqlite3.c" amalgamation and the resulting binary is moved to the target
computer and executed.  TCL scripts automate this entire process on
all major host platforms.

</p><p>
To verify that the TH3 tests really do provide 100% MC/DC, special options
are added to the TCL scripts that run the tests, causing the GCC coverage
analysis tools to be invoked.  The output of gcov is then postprocessed to
reveal and report any branch instructions that were missed by the tests.
The TH3 tests themselves are all implemented in C and SQL, but the operation
and management of those tests is all done with TCL.

</p><h3>2.5 TCL Generated Documentation</h3>

<p>
The extensive documentation for SQLite available on the SQLite website
(<a href="https://sqlite.org/">https://sqlite.org/</a>) is all generated
by TCL.  Many of the documents, such as the API reference documentation and
the descriptions of the byte-code engine opcodes, are created by TCL scripts
that scan C source code and extract the necessary information from the code
and comments.  Thus, the API documentation is largely derived from
comments in the source code.  Keeping the official documentation (in
comments) and the source code close together helps ensure that they are
in agreement.

</p><p>
Other whitepaper documents are generated from source files that look 
mostly like
HTML but which contain additional TCL code embedded inside of
&lt;tcl&gt;...&lt;/tcl&gt; markup.  The added TCL code is used for
advanced formatting techniques, for automatically creating cross-references
and cross-links, and for constructing complex displays such as the
popular "rail-road" syntax diagrams for SQL.

</p><h3>2.6 Tcl/Tk Used During Development Of SQLite</h3>

<p>
The text editor used by the primary author of SQLite is a custom editor
with emacs-style key bindings that is built on top of the Tk Text widget.
The "e" editor, as it is called, is cross-platform, which helps in the
development of a cross-platform software library like SQLite.  The "e"
editor has been used for the entire 17-year history of SQLite.  It has
been enhanced over the years with various customizations created especially
to help manage the SQLite source code.

</p><p>
The Fossil version control system used for the SQLite source code
(and written specifically for that purpose) uses Tcl/Tk to show graphical
side-by-side diffs in a separate window.  When the "fossil diff --tk"
command is run, Fossil generates a script to show the diff graphically
and then kicks off a separate "wish" process to run that script and
display the diff in a separate window.  This graphical diff window has
a "Save" button which will cause the Tcl/Tk code needed to reproduce itself
to be written to a file.  This file can be, in turn, sent to a collaborator
for display.  Passing around graphical diffs as ordinary text files is
much simpler and easier than passing around JPEG images or text "context"
diffs.

</p><p>
No two SQLite developers work in the same office.  The team is
geographically distributed.  To help the team stay in touch, a custom
chatroom has been created using a Tcl/Tk script.  The same script works
as both client and server.  The chatroom is private and uses a proprietary
protocol, so that developers are free to discuss sensitive matters without
fear of eavesdropping.  The chatroom is implemented as just over
1000 lines of Tk code, and is thus accessible and easy to customize.
Among the customizations is the ability to send saved "fossil diff --tk"
graphical diffs to collaborators and have the diff pop automatically on
the collaborators screen.  Small features like this seem trivial
by themselves, but together than help the developers
to work much more efficiently.  These kinds of productivity-enhancing
features are unavailable to users of commercial business collaboration 
packages such as HipChat.

</p><h2>3.0 Summary</h2>

<p>
SQLite is an indispensable element of most modern computer systems, and
TCL is an indispensable tool used in the production and maintenance of
SQLite.  Thus, the computing infrastructure we enjoy today would not exist
except for TCL.

</p><p>
As deployed, SQLite contains no TCL code.
However, the design of SQLite is inspired by TCL.
And TCL is used extensively in the code generation, testing,
analysis, documentation, and development of SQLite.  Without
TCL, SQLite would not exist.

</p><p>
Every developer and every team has a finite number of "brain cycles"
available to do their job.  The fewer cycles spent messing with tools,
the more cycles are available to devote towards solving the problem.
So for maximum productivity, it is important to use tools that get
the job done with a minimum of fuss and bother.
Our 17-year experience using TCL in the SQLite project has convinced
us that TCL is just such a tool.  Tcl provides the most help per
brain cycle of any similar technology.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>When I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/research-goblin/">how good ChatGPT with GPT-5</a> is at search yesterday I nearly added a note about how comparatively disappointing Google's efforts around this are.</p>
<p>I'm glad I left that out, because it turns out Google's new "AI mode" is genuinely really good! It feels  very similar to GPT-5 search but returns results <em>much</em> faster.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/ai">www.google.com/ai</a></strong> (not available in the EU, as I found out this morning since I'm staying in France for a few days.)</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://share.google/aimode/SZNHD7Owi0Wv9d3Ci">what I got</a> for the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic but lots of physical books and cut them up and scan them for training data. Do any other AI labs do the same thing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of search results page with navigation tabs &quot;AI Mode&quot; and more.  Main search query reads &quot;Anthropic but lots of physical books and cut them up and scan them for training data. Do any other AI labs do the same thing?&quot; Results show &quot;11 sites&quot; and include text: &quot;In 2024, Anthropic paid millions of dollars to buy physical books in bulk, which they then cut up, scanned, and discarded to train their AI models. This method was a major component of a copyright lawsuit settlement that Anthropic paid in September 2025. While Anthropic took this destructive, large-scale approach, other major AI labs have taken different routes to acquire book data.&quot; Followed by &quot;Here's how other AI companies have sourced book data:&quot; with bullet points for &quot;OpenAI and Microsoft: In June 2025, the companies announced a partnership with Harvard University libraries to train AI models on digitized, public-domain books. This non-destructive method provides high-quality text while preserving the original physical copies.&quot; &quot;Meta: Meta has been accused of relying on large-scale piracy to build its datasets for models like LLaMA. In 2025, a search tool revealed that Meta had copied more than 7.5 million books from the pirate site LibGen for its AI systems.&quot; &quot;Google: Decades before the current AI boom, Google pioneered non-destructive scanning methods for its Google Books project. This method became a successful legal precedent for digitizing copyrighted works for internal purposes. In 2024, Anthropic hired the former head of this project, Tom Turvey, to help with its own book-acquisition strategy." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ai-mode-books.jpg"></p>
<p>I'll be honest: I hadn't spent much time with AI mode for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>My expectations of "AI mode" were extremely low based on my terrible experience of "AI overviews"</li>
<li>The name "AI mode" is so generic!</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on some initial experiments I'm impressed - Google finally seem to be taking full advantage of their search infrastructure for building out truly great AI-assisted search.</p>
<p>I do have one disappointment: AI mode will tell you that it's "running 5 searches" but it won't tell you what those searches are! Seeing the searches that were run is really important for me in evaluating the likely quality of the end results. I've had the same problem with Google's Gemini app in the past - the lack of transparency as to what it's doing really damages my trust.</p>
