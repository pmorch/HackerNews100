<h3>About Feynman's Messenger Lectures</h3>

<p>
In 1963 Richard Feynman was invited to give the 1964 Messenger Lectures at Cornell University, an annual tradition since 1924, when Hiram Messenger gifted Cornell with "a fund to provide a course of lectures on the Evolution of Civilization for the special purpose of raising the moral standard of our political, business, and social life", to be "delivered by the ablest non-resident lecturer or lecturers obtainable".</p>

<p>
Feynman had been a physics professor at Cornell from 1945 to 1950, during which time he did the work for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1965. While at Cornell Feynman became well-known in the physics community for his innovations in quantum electrodynamics and idosyncratic style. He was at Caltech in 1963, when he was invited to become the 41st Messenger Lecturer<a id="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a>, by which time he had become known to a much wider audience through his recently published book, Volume I of <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics.</i><a id="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>
 According to the Cornell Faculty Website, "A Messenger Lecturer typically gives three lectures/presentations over the course of a one-week visit. At least one of these must be a lecture that is suitable for a general audience."<a id="footnote_source_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Feynman, however, chose to give a series of <i>six</i> lectures, <i>all</i> for a general audience, which he titled <i>The Character of Physical Law</i>.<a id="footnote_source_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>4</sup></a> He had plenty of material to draw from his recently completed introductory physics course, the basis of <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>. For this reason one finds many similarities, parallels, and even identical parts in the lectures of <i>The Character of Physical Law</i> and several of the lectures in <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>.</p>
 
 <p>
Feynman's Messenger Lectures were videotaped by the BBC, who in 1965 published a hardbound book of edited lecture transcripts under the title, <i>The Character of Physical Law</i>. In 1967 the paperback rights were licensed to MIT Press who continues to print the book today.<a id="footnote_source_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>5</sup></a> The videotapes were transferred to film, and in the late 1960s through the '70s copies of the films were in wide distribution at colleges and universities.<a id="footnote_source_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Sadly, however, these wonderful films of Feynman lecturing at the peak of his prowess went out of distribution and became generally unavailable in the 1980s.</p>

<p>
In 2009, when Microsoft Research introduced their Silverlight framework for media-rich web applications, Bill Gates licensed rights to stream the BBC's films of Feynman’s Messenger Lectures online. Hoping to encourage others to make educational content available for free, he used them in the first Silverlight demo, “Project Tuva.”<a id="footnote_source_7" href="#footnote_7"><sup>7</sup></a> The publication of Feynman’s Messenger Lectures for free online viewing, with special features such as searchable synchronized scrolling transcripts, links to related online material, and  commentary, was an instant hit with Feynman fans, students and physicists. The Silverlight framework, however, was not widely adopted, and in 2016 Project Tuva was retired. The videos were still available for viewing on the Microsoft Research Website (though without the special features) until 2021, when their BBC license expired. The license has since been generously renewed by Bill Gates so that the videos can continue to be shown online to users of The Feynman Lectures Website.</p>

From: Rich Felker &lt;dalias@...c.org&gt;
To: musl@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: musl 1.2.4 released

This release adds TCP fallback to the DNS stub resolver, fixing the
longstanding inability to query large DNS records and incompatibility
with recursive nameservers that don't give partial results in
truncated UDP responses. It also makes a number of other bug fixes and
improvements in DNS and related functionality, including making both
the modern and legacy API results differentiate between NODATA and
NxDomain conditions so that the caller can handle them differently.

On the API level, the legacy "LFS64" ("large file support")
interfaces, which were provided by macros remapping them to their
standard names (#define stat64 stat and similar) have been deprecated
and are no longer provided under the _GNU_SOURCE feature profile, only
under explicit _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE. The latter will also be removed in
a future version. Builds broken by this change can be fixed short-term
by adding -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE to CFLAGS, but should be fixed to use
the standard interfaces.

The dynamic linker (and static-PIE entry point code) adds support for
the new compact "RELR" format for relative relocations which recent
linkers can generate. Use of this linker feature for dynamic-linked
programs will make them depend on having musl 1.2.4 or later available
at runtime. Static-linkied PIE binaries using it, as always, are
self-contained and have no such dependency.

A large number of bugs have been fixed, including many in the wide
printf family of functions, incorrect ordering of digits vs non-digits
in strverscmp, and several rare race-condition corner cases in thread
synchronization logic at thread exit time, in multi-threaded fork,
pthread_detach, and POSIX semaphores.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemprop="blogPost"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
<p>I've spent a week cosplaying as a disabled user. And I hate it.</p><p>A couple of months ago, I attended a private talk given by a disabled colleague of mine. "Everyone should believe disabled people's stories about accessibility problems," she said. "But, given that people don't, here's what I want you to do. Spend one week pretending to be disabled. Pick a disability and try to interact with services as though you have that impairment. Build up some empathy."</p><p>So I did.</p><p>For a week, I pretended that I was in a wheelchair. I didn't go the full way and buy a cheap chair and try and commute in it. Instead, whenever I was invited to speak at an event, or go to a meeting, I asked if the venue was accessible.  To my delight, all of them were.  A couple of people told me they'd arrange ramps to the stage, or that they'd need to adjust a podium height if I wanted.</p><p>Except one. I turned up to find the talk had been moved to the 3rd floor of a building with no lift. I'd specifically asked the organisers if the room was wheelchair friendly. They'd had more people turn up than expected, so moved to a bigger room.  At no point did the organisers contact me.</p><p>I turned up (without a chair) and briefly considered leaving. Instead I sent a sternly worded email.</p><p>The week left me feeling fairly hopeful. OK, it wasn't a full test - and there was a failure - but in my little bubble of society, people are (mostly) welcoming to wheelchair users.</p><p>Then it all went wrong.</p><p>The next week, I tried something different. Approximately <a href="https://www.thecommunicationtrust.org.uk/media/2612/communication_difficulties_-_facts_and_stats.pdf">10% of people in the UK have a speech disorder</a>. In the USA, <a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/statistics-voice-speech-and-language">approximately 7.5 million people have trouble using their voices</a>.</p><p>So, I tried to spend a week without using the phone to contact companies. It was a fucking disaster.</p><p>I wanted to upgrade my Internet access to a faster speed. Virgin Media provide a web chat - and after a few hours of waiting (seriously!) I had this frustrating exchange (edited for clarity - typos left intact):</p><ul><li>John: If you wish to avail of this deal . I advise you to call our Customer Care Team.</li><li>Terence: I can't use the phone due to my disability. Can I chat online to do it?</li><li>John: To reach our customer care. You can just download the app and quickly chat with the team there;</li><li>Terence: I've tried using the app - but no one answers. Please can you help me. I've been a customer for 6 years.</li><li>John: We appreciate your loyalty Terence, but we are are only limited to regular upgrade transacations.</li><li>Terence: So disabled customers can't upgrade via chat?</li><li>John: For persons with diabilities, there are options at "Contact Us"</li><li>Terence: I tried that - and it redirected me here. Is there anyone who can help?</li><li>John: I'm so sorry ternce but transactiosn like this can only be arranged by calling Custome care team.</li></ul><p>So I asked to cancel my account.</p><ul><li>Terence: If I want to cancel my account (without using the phone) what can I do?</li><li>John: the only option though is by calling . Call 150 from your Virgin Media phone or mobile, or call 0345 454 1111 * from any other phone Monday to Friday, 8am until 9pm Saturday, 8am until 8pm and Sunday 8am until 6pm For our text relay service call us free on 18001 0800 052 2164 You can also contact us through a sign language interpreter. Open 7 days a week, 8am until midnight. *For call costs to our team from a Virgin Media home phone, visit our Call costs page. Calls from other networks and mobile may vary.</li><li>Terence: This is discrimination. I don't know sign language and I don't have text relay. I can't use my voice. I want to contact someone to cancel my account.</li><li>John: If the voice is the issue, i advise you ask someone to call in  your behalf.</li><li>Terence: I am perfectly capable of managing my affairs - and I don't want to give my password to someone else.</li></ul><p>And so it went on. I spent hours chatting with different people, and with managers. None of them could help me with an upgrade, or with a cancellation.</p><p>Virgin accessibility police says:</p><blockquote><p>
2.1 We are committed to ensuring both vulnerable and disabled customers get fair and appropriate treatment.<br>
2.2 To ensure we meet the needs of current and prospective customers, our sales and support teams are trained to identify and support the accessibility and vulnerability needs people may have.<br>
<a href="https://www.virginmedia.com/corporate/media-centre/public-policy-statements/accessibility-and-vulnerability-policy">https://www.virginmedia.com/corporate/media-centre/public-policy-statements/accessibility-and-vulnerability-policy</a></p></blockquote><p>As far as I can see, that's a load of bunkum. If you don't have a voice, you're locked out of Virgin's upgrade and cancellation routes.</p><p>I raised a complaint, and got back this fairly generic and dismissive response:</p><blockquote><p>
Please accept my apologies for this experience, , this is not the experience we want for our customers.   We have fed your comments back to the relevant team, this will help us to highlight certain training needs and form coaching. There are areas where improvements can always be made, and as a customer-orientated organisation we are always endeavouring to improve both how we deal with customers and the range and quality of the services we offer.</p></blockquote><p>No actual resolution. It made me feel like a burden for even asking for help. I can't go through the "normal" channels - I have to rely on the good graces of a complaints team.  It was frustrating and demoralising.</p><p>The same thing happened with Thames Water.  If you want to move your account, they ask you to fill in a form online. Hurrah! Until you get to one bit of it, where it tells you to ring a phone number.</p><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/thameswater?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@thameswater</a>, I'm trying to move house. Your website says the contact number is 0800 000 0000.<br>I assume that's placeholder text as the number is answered by the Prudential!<br>What number should I call?<a href="https://t.co/fT3DzPIy4M">https://t.co/fT3DzPIy4M</a> <a href="https://t.co/AGQ2FqMyr0">pic.twitter.com/AGQ2FqMyr0</a></p><p>— Terence Eden (@edent) <a href="https://twitter.com/edent/status/1155502091122724864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2019</a></p></blockquote><p>I had a frustrating chat on Twitter with Thames Water. They admitted the phone number was wrong, and struggled to provide me with contact details.</p><p>I tried to use their complaints process, but that requires a 10 digit account number. But Thames have upgraded me to a 12 digit number - so their own form doesn't work!</p><p>So now I'm stuck in limbo. Waiting for someone to get back to me. I've told them not to call - but I bet you they try to ring me.</p><p>My bank had similar issues. UK banking is <em>great</em> for most online users. I was able to set up new payees, order a new card, cancel Direct Debit - all without using my voice.  And then I tried to buy a house...</p><p>I needed to transfer a large sum of money in order to put a deposit down on my new place. It was larger than the standard transfer limit. And the <em>only</em> solution was to call them up.</p><p>They do have an online messaging service, but from experience it's slow to answer - and I needed to transfer the money immediately (the home buying process in England is dysfunctional).  If I truly had no voice, I'd have lost the house I was trying to buy.</p><p>I appreciate the need for security. And for double-checking transactions. And all that good stuff. But I was trapped. So I caved in and called.</p><h2 id="i-have-no-mouth-and-i-must-scream"><a href="#i-have-no-mouth-and-i-must-scream">I have no mouth and I must scream</a></h2><p>You should believe your disabled friends and colleagues when they tell you how crap the world can be.</p><p>You should also try empathy building exercises. Here are some examples, please add your own in the comments:</p><ul><li>Go a couple of weeks without using the phone. Which services are closed off to you?</li><li>Tell people you need an accessible venue for your meetings.  How do they respond?</li><li>Turn off images in your browser. Is there enough alt-text for you to navigate the web?</li><li>Switch on subtitles and mute your favourite shows. Do they even have subtitles? What do you miss?</li><li>Hire or buy a wheelchair for a week. How easy is your office to navigate? (Please don't block the accessible loos though!)</li><li>Buy a pair of <a href="http://www.inclusivedesigntoolkit.com/gloves/gloves.html">arthritis simulating gloves</a>. What does the world feel like with limited mobility?</li></ul><p>But, most of all, record how it makes you feel. After a few fruitless hours pleading with my ISP, I was ready to kick something. Now imagine that every day.</p><p>Whether you work in tech or not - it is your duty to make sure that no one feels demoralised or rejected because of the systems you build.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

It also sounds like the kind of operation that venture capitalists would value at over a billion dollars.</p><p>The premise is simple, they say: As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, approaching the level of human-superior artificial general intelligence, it will both create wealth and disrupt labor markets as human workers are replaced by machines. It will also become increasingly challenging to distinguish human from machine, as the current-day problem of bots mimicking humans online is made worse by sophisticated AI fakes. Or at least, that’s today’s problem. Check back in a month or two and see if it’s changed.</p><p><span>Worldcoin is, at the moment, a project to distribute cryptocurrency tokens (</span><em>also</em><span> called Worldcoin, or WLD) to those who confirm they are human by having their irises scanned by a custom piece of hardware that both captures its subject’s unique iris “fingerprint” and performs biometric scans to ensure it’s scanning a living, breathing human being and not a printout or some other fake. That custom hardware just so happens to be a chrome orb that evokes HAL 9000.</span></p><p><span>Worldcoin was founded by Sam Altman, the “tech visionary” </span><em>du jour</em><span> who is behind OpenAI. That’s right, the guy who’s going to sell us all the solution to a worsening AI-powered bot infestation of the Internet and to AI-induced mass unemployment is the same guy who’s making the AI in question.</span></p><p><span>He is selling the antidote to the poison he is, coincidentally, </span><em>also</em><span> selling.</span></p><p><span>In June 2022 I wrote an essay titled “</span><a href="https://blog.mollywhite.net/is-acceptably-non-dystopian-self-sovereign-identity-even-possible/" rel="">Is ‘acceptably non-dystopian’ self-sovereign identity even possible?</a><span>“. This was prompted not by Worldcoin, but by a </span><em>different</em><span> identity-related project: Vitalik Buterin’s conception of “soulbound tokens”. In a May 2022 </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763" rel="">paper</a><span> he co-authored with E. Glen Weyl and Puja Ohlhaver, he wrote that these identity projects (and related ideas they group under the umbrella of “decentralized society”) must meet the rather low bar of being merely “acceptably non-dystopian” in order to be worth pursuing.</span></p><p><span>In that essay, I wrote about the problem of decentralized identity: that is, how do you determine that someone is who they say they are without relying on a centralized authority (e.g., government-issued identification)? This has been a popular topic in the cryptoverse because of the Sybil problem: the challenge of ensuring that one individual does not operate multiple identities (or crypto wallets) while also respecting anonymity (or pseudonymity). Worldcoin is among the projects trying to solve this problem, sometimes termed “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_personhood" rel="">proof of personhood</a><span>”, but hardly the only one. Proof of Humanity, BrightID, and others are doing so as well. They use a range of approaches, from biometrics (Worldcoin) to web-of-trust vouching (BrightID) to some sort of a mix (Proof of Humanity incorporates both vouching and uploading a video of one’s face for verification).</span></p><p>Identity projects aim to answer one or several of the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>Is this user a human?</p></li><li><p><span>Is this user a </span><em>unique</em><span> human? (i.e., do they only control one identity in a given network?)</span></p></li><li><p>Can this user prove they meet some criteria? (e.g., are they over 18? are they a U.S. citizen?)</p></li><li><p>Can this user prove they are a specific person? (e.g., does Molly White control this identity?)</p></li></ol><p><span>If you’ve ever solved a CAPTCHA you probably understand why it’s useful to answer the first question — bot prevention is important and inarguably becoming </span><em>more</em><span> important as bots become more convincing, more disruptive, and more capable of evading anti-bot measures.</span></p><p>The second is useful for ensuring fairness in systems such as voting. In the cryptocurrency world, many DAOs follow the one-token-one-vote model, which makes them susceptible to control by the wealthiest actors. A robust proof-of-personhood solution could, ideally, allow for one-person-one-vote without sacrificing crypto’s beloved pseudonymity. Some also envision decentralized proof of uniqueness as helping with fraud protection in other systems, ranging from ensuring people only get one NFT in an NFT airdrop all the way to critical social welfare programs or universal basic income schemes.</p><p>The third question is distinct from the fourth in that there are times when people might wish to provably answer specific yes or no questions such as “are you over 18?” or “are you a U.S. citizen?” without disclosing their full identity. This is not widely done today: websites generally either ask if you meet the criteria (and simply trust that you aren’t lying), or require you to submit a government-issued ID to prove it (and thus also require you to disclose your full identity to them).</p><p>The fourth question is critical for high-importance activities, like signing legal documents, opening a bank account, or applying for a loan.</p><p><span>Worldcoin is primarily concerned with answering questions 1 and 2: ensuring everyone who is represented in the Worldcoin network is a real person, and only controls one identity in the system. The reasons </span><em>why</em><span> they want to do this have shifted since the project emerged in 2019, making the project hard to pin down. First they seemed most focused on wealth redistribution. Then, during the height of crypto hype, the story centered around onboarding new users to crypto and solving its Sybil problem. More recently, Worldcoin pivoted to the more AI-focused story now that AI is the hot big thing and founder Sam Altman has become its poster boy.</span></p><p><span>The types of things Worldcoin says it could one day do are lofty: “considerably increase economic opportunity, scale a reliable solution for distinguishing humans from AI online while preserving privacy, enable global democratic processes, and show a potential path to AI-funded UBI [universal basic income].“</span></p><p>That’s right: the founders aren’t looking to merely create the next generation of CAPTCHAs, they want to form the base of future democracy and social welfare.</p><p><span>To join the Worldcoin network, people download the World App crypto wallet on their smartphone. They then find a nearby Orb, submit to its iris scan and other biometric humanness-detection, become “</span><em>Orb-verified”</em><span> and receive a World ID. To accomplish this, the Orb scans the iris, applies its special algorithm so that it can compare the iris scan to the others in its database and ensure uniqueness (while accounting for the fact that two scans of the same iris may not be visually identical due to factors such as lighting or angle), and verifies the ID if the iris is indeed new to the database.</span></p><p><span>Worldcoin is very quick to insist that they do not store the iris scan data directly, but rather store an “IrisCode”, which they describe as a mere “set of numbers” on its website.</span></p><p><span> The IrisCode has been widely described in media as a “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" rel="">hashed</a><span>” version of the iris scan, and indeed used to be called an “IrisHash” by WorldCoin, but references to hashes seem to have been (somewhat incompletely) scrubbed from the website as of late. Worldcoin tries to insist that they don’t store sensitive biometrics, a claim that requires everyone to simply go along with their assumption that a per-person unique IrisCode </span><em>itself</em><span> is not sensitive data. It’s also not terribly clear yet what kind of data might be leaked by the IrisCode — for example, Vitalik Buterin has questioned if some traits captured in the code might reflect things like sex, ethnicity, or medical conditions.</span></p><p><span>Worldcoin is also considerably less forward about the fact that they encourage users who sign up to “opt in” to image custody. For those who opt in, WorldCoin continues to store the original iris images, they say “because the algorithm that computes the iris code is still evolving to make sure it can support signing up everyone”.</span></p><p><span> With Orbs still relatively scarce, users face the risk of being removed from the pool of verified World ID holders as the algorithm is refined, unless they either have ongoing access to an Orb at which they can be re-scanned, or acquiesce to their original data being retained.</span></p><p>Because the vague promises of maybe someday enabling DAO voting or AI-necessitated UBI are both intangible and probably unappealing to many of the massive number of people Worldcoin hopes to onboard (ranging from several billion to every single human on the planet, depending on which exec you ask and when), Worldcoin has decided to just pay people for their eyeballs.</p><p><span>But rather than handing out cold hard cash, those who sign up receive 25 Worldcoin tokens (WLD), and the opportunity to claim 1 WLD per week going forward. Or at least those in approved jurisdictions do — US-based users can’t receive tokens in return due to pesky regulatory concerns, and in several states or cities can’t be scanned at all.</span></p><p><span> The app is also not available in some jurisdictions, including mainland China.</span></p><p><span> And privacy regulators are already sniffing around in various European markets where Worldcoin has recently started scanning irises in a push following its big launch this week.</span></p><p><span>At the beginning of Worldcoin’s iris-scanning endeavours, the WLD that people received was no more than an IOU, since the token hadn’t yet launched. Since the token launch on July 24, the price has fluctuated between $1.94 and $2.69 — as of writing, it is hovering at around $2.35, making the initial 25-token distribution worth around $59 to anyone who immediately cashes out.</span></p><p>If by now you’ve found yourself thinking “scan my irises and give the data to a bunch of VC-backed tech bros in exchange for tokens that may or may not be worth around $60? sign me up!”, well, keep reading.</p><p><span>A caveat: Worldcoin is at this stage so incredibly vague about what exactly they envision people using the project </span><em>for</em><span> that it is difficult to analyze. I would certainly be asking very different questions of a project that simply aims to ensure people are only receiving their fair allotment of promotional NFTs than of one with aspirations of becoming the voting apparatus for “global democracy” or the operator of a worldwide universal basic income program.</span></p><p><span>Before launching in to future-facing issues with Worldcoin, it’s worth touching on its history a little bit. In April 2022, </span><em><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/" rel="">MIT Technology Review</a></em><span> and </span><em><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/richardnieva/worldcoin-crypto-eyeball-scanning-orb-problems" rel="">BuzzFeed News</a></em><span> nearly simultaneously published longform articles stemming from their investigations of the project, particularly focusing on their experimentation in low-income communities, often in developing countries, and on individuals who did not always understand what they were agreeing to. The articles detailed numerous issues with the company, including unconscionable treatment of their hired “Orb operators”, the widespread use of questionable tactics to entice new people to sign up, inconsistent messaging about exactly what kind of data was being collected or preserved, and lack of compliance with local data privacy policies. Both articles are well worth the read.</span></p><p><span>Much of Worldcoin’s promises are predicated on the questionable idea that highly sophisticated artificial intelligence, even artificial general intelligence, is right around the corner. It also hinges on the “robots will take our jobs!” panic — a </span><a href="https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d" rel="">staple of the last couple centuries</a><span> — finally coming to bear. Worldcoin offers other use cases for its product too, like DAO voting, but it is not the promise to solve DAO voting that earned them a multi-billion dollar valuation from venture capitalists.</span></p><p><span>Other use cases that Worldcoin has offered seem to assume that various entities — governments, software companies, etc. — would actually </span><em>want</em><span> to use the Worldcoin system. This seems highly dubious to me, particularly given that many governments have established identification systems that already enjoy widespread use. Some even employ biometrics of their own, like India’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar" rel="">Aadhaar</a><span>. There’s also the scalability question: Worldcoin operates on the Optimism Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, a much speedier alternative to the layer-1 Ethereum chain to be sure, but any blockchain is liable to be a poor candidate for handling the kind of volume demanded by a multi-billion user system processing everyday transactions.</span></p><p>And finally, bafflingly, Worldcoin seems to think it —&nbsp;a VC-backed corporation — is best positioned to save the world from this forecasted AI-induced economic upheaval via “AI-funded universal basic income”.</p><p>If you ask the proof-of-personhood folks, centralized identity systems suffer from unacceptable flaws, namely lack of privacy and the risk that the maintainer of the identity system could act maliciously towards members of the network (or could be corrupted or taken over by someone who does). They have some good points.</p><p>But Worldcoin itself is enormously centralized, and at this point, talk of decentralization is little more than handwavy promises. The custom Orb hardware presents a massive obstacle to decentralization that Worldcoin doesn’t seem to have meaningfully grappled with. If Worldcoin is the only group producing these Orbs, they exercise sole control over them — which, in turn, provides them the sole ability to introduce backdoors.</p><p><span>If the Orbs hardware is “decentralized”, which Worldcoin says they intend to do,</span></p><p><span> they then have to ensure that the Orbs are properly constructed following the design specifications they’ve provided, and haven’t been modified to maliciously create IDs outside of the intended mechanism. Worldcoin speaks vaguely of a third-party auditing system and allowlisting process that would attempt to catch any such malicious Orbs, but the scale of such audits required to allow for the quantity of Orbs to achieve billions of signups would be enormous. Furthermore, because Worldcoin incorporates cryptocurrency distributions, any bad actor who was able to slip through a malicious Orb capable of generating fake IDs could rapidly siphon WLD tokens, and even if discovered, the past distribution could not be reversed — they could only be prevented from continuing to create new IDs.</span></p><p><span>The cryptocurrency industry is rife with projects that embrace the idea of “progressive decentralization”: beginning out as a highly centralized project run by a small group, but promising to eventually turn over control of the project to a DAO. Few ever follow through,</span></p><p><span> but it is a convenient way to stave off criticism.</span></p><p>When questioned about the wisdom of attempting to form a huge database of iris scans, Worldcoin argues that only the IrisCode is stored.</p><p>When questioned about the wisdom of creating a system to accomplish everything from voting to welfare to everyday purchases, irrevocably tied to an individual person, all using public blockchains, Worldcoin argues “zero knowledge proofs!” </p><p>End of argument. Concerns assuaged. And indeed, some Worldcoin boosters seem satisfied with these very superficial answers, likely dazzled by the technical details that Worldcoin throws around with their posts about Gabor wavelets and phase-quadrant demodulation and poseidon hashes.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b5839a-c046-40d9-aff0-d07041873d43_1740x1116.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b5839a-c046-40d9-aff0-d07041873d43_1740x1116.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b5839a-c046-40d9-aff0-d07041873d43_1740x1116.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b5839a-c046-40d9-aff0-d07041873d43_1740x1116.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b5839a-c046-40d9-aff0-d07041873d43_1740x1116.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b5839a-c046-40d9-aff0-d07041873d43_1740x1116.png" width="1456" height="934" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d9b5839a-c046-40d9-aff0-d07041873d43_1740x1116.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:934,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:686045,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b5839a-c046-40d9-aff0-d07041873d43_1740x1116.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b5839a-c046-40d9-aff0-d07041873d43_1740x1116.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b5839a-c046-40d9-aff0-d07041873d43_1740x1116.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9b5839a-c046-40d9-aff0-d07041873d43_1740x1116.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Excerpt from a Worldcoin </span><a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/engineering/iris-feature-extraction" rel="">post</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>But simply saying “we transform the iris data into something else” and “we’ll use zero knowledge proofs” should not be sufficient.</p><p><span>It is necessary to understand what kind of data can be leaked from the iris hashing algorithm — an algorithm that the team acknowledges is frequently changing. It is </span><em>also</em><span> necessary to understand what kinds of attacks could be enabled both on the network or on an individual participant if a malicious actor was able to obtain access to a participant’s data, ranging from a person’s WorldID account, to their IrisCode, to their full unhashed iris scan. This is a really critical issue, because there is no “password reset” when it comes to iris data. Questions about account recovery also remain unanswered — in previous reports, a person who uninstalled their World App was never able to regain access to their account.</span></p><p>There are also unanswered questions about the scalability of such an algorithm to the populations that Worldcoin is hoping to reach — past iterations of the algorithm have allowed one person to register multiple times, or have denied people access when they hadn’t already created an ID. While Worldcoin may have developed an algorithm that reliably distinguishes unique irises among its test pool, it’s not clear that it will work with a pool orders of magnitude larger.</p><p><span>As for zero knowledge proofs, Worldcoin trots this out as an answer to concerns about potentially connecting substantial amounts of sensitive data (transaction history and so forth) to a single permanent identifier. ZK proofs are a way of proving that something is true (e.g., “I have a valid World ID”, or “I’ve not yet received my WLD distribution this week”) without revealing additional details (e.g., which World ID is mine). But the implementation of this would be critical, and much of the burden here would lie on third parties — corporations, governments, etc. — that Worldcoin envisions adopting their system. A permanent record of potentially incredibly sensitive transaction histories, irrevocably linked to a biometric identifier, is a nightmare scenario. Worldcoin acknowledges this issue with no further elaboration: “While the Protocol is made to be used in a privacy-preserving manner, privacy cannot be enforced outside of the Protocol.”</span></p><p>Furthermore, Worldcoin relies heavily on each user’s ability and technical know-how to keep track of their private key, writing, “private keys need to remain private, as otherwise, a user can deanonymize themselves, even to actions they have performed in the past“.</p><p><span>Anti-surveillance advocate and Nym co-founder Harry Halpin describes Worldcoin’s knee-jerk “ZK proofs!” dismissal of privacy concerns — a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1629730719437078529" rel="">frequent habit in the wider crypto world</a><span> — as “zero-knowledge washing“: “taking a fundamentally evil concept or dubious concept and trying to make it look socially acceptable by adding some zero-knowledge fairy dust on top of it.” He also expresses doubts about the longevity of ZK proofs, expecting “quantum computing [to] break zero-knowledge proofs“ in five to ten years,</span></p><p><span> though he and I differ somewhat on that particular prediction.</span></p><p><span>Those who resist Worldcoin’s initial rebuttals and continue to push the company on privacy concerns are then faced with Worldcoin’s next tactic: arguing that we </span><em>already</em><span> give up privacy in today’s society, so what’s a little more? Spokespeople trot out whataboutism with Apple and Google biometric scanning, and various backers argue that iris images are already widely distributed: “You have a headshot on your website. You walk around with your eyes open in front of cameras all day long.“</span></p><p><span>And if that doesn’t work? Well, there’s always investor Kyle Samani’s argument: “When it comes to Worldcoin, you don’t have to scan your eyeball. Like if you don’t want to, then fucking don’t.”</span></p><p><span> This option is reasonable — indeed, quite tempting — if Worldcoin is relegated to the realm of the trivial, enabling NFT airdrops and the like. When it comes to more important use cases, “optional” biometrics suddenly become much more problematic. For example, in India, HIV patients have found themselves needing to submit their “optional” biometrics-linked Aadhaar identification number in order to access antiretroviral therapies.</span></p><p><span>It’s not yet clear how Worldcoin envisions WLD functioning. They refer to it as a “digital currency” which “could… become the widest distributed digital asset”. If Worldcoin is to function as a currency, as you might expect of an asset that’s being distributed in a universal basic income program, it would need to overcome the same types of issues that keep Bitcoin from functioning </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_bitcoin#Classification" rel="">anything like a currency</a><span>.</span></p><p>If it is to be more of a speculative asset that people hoard in hopes of the price going up, it seems ill-suited to Worldcoin’s UBI ambitions.</p><p><span>Furthermore, the initial token distribution looks a lot more like what you would expect out of the venture capital world than out of a public good organization. Worldcoin has generously reserved for insiders 25% of the WLD supply (up from an initial 20%, because development was evidently more “complex and costly” than anticipated).</span></p><p><span>It stands to reason that Worldcoin’s token distribution looks VC backed, and that’s because it is. In May, Worldcoin raised $115 million in a Series C round led by Blockchain Capital and joined by Bain Capital Crypto, Distributed Global, and, of course, </span><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/andreessen-horowitzs-state-of-crypto" rel="">Andreessen Horowitz</a><span>.</span></p><p><span> One wonders how they will balance their do-gooder mission with their need to generate massive returns for their backers.</span></p><p>Worldcoin’s loftier goals include “enabl[ing] global democratic processes”, providing global access to financial services, and even paying out AI-funded global universal basic income.</p><p>That is, if you have a smartphone and the technical know-how to use it, Internet connectivity, and access to an Orb. For Worldcoin’s more financial ambitions, people would also need access to an exchange where they could swap WLD for their local currency, or WLD would need to be widely adopted as a form of payment by merchants.</p><p><span>Today, an estimated 66% of the world uses a smartphone.</span></p><p><span> Around the same percentage has access to the Internet, but this varies immensely by region, and is impacted by other factors including wealth and gender.</span></p><p><span>Access to Orbs is a much more existential issue for the project: there are 346 Orbs out there in the world right now: that is one per every 23 million people. Worldcoin announced they will be rolling out</span></p><p><span> more Orbs to reach a total number of 1,500 — meaning that then a mere 5.3 million people would have to travel to and line up per Orb.</span></p><p><span> Sam Altman has recently boasted (without evidence) that one person is being signed up every eight seconds.</span></p><p><span> With their claimed two million signups as a head start, at that rate they’ll have all 8 billion people in the world signed up by 2055 (assuming no population change, or change in rate of signup).</span></p><p>Finally, if Worldcoin truly wishes to onboard every person in the world, or be used for critical tasks, they will at some point have to grapple with the fact that not everyone has irises that can be scanned, due to factors including birth defects, surgeries, or disease.</p><p>“Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome,” says Charlie Munger.</p><p>What will happen when you promise people anywhere from $10 to $100 for scanning their eyeball? What if that’s not dollars, but denominated in a crypto token, making it appealing to speculators? And what if some people don’t have the option to scan their own eyeballs to achieve access to it?</p><p><span>A black market for Worldcoin accounts has </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=sam-altmans-worldcoin-project-incentivizes-a-black-market-for-biometric-data-taken-from-people-in-developing-nations" rel="">already emerged</a><span> in Cambodia, Nigeria, and elsewhere, where people are being paid to sign up for a World ID and then transfer ownership to buyers elsewhere — many of whom are in China, where Worldcoin is restricted. There is no ongoing verification process to ensure that a World ID </span><em>continues</em><span> to belong to the person who signed up for it, and no way for the eyeball-haver to recover an account that is under another person’s control. Worldcoin acknowledges that they have no clue how to resolve the issue: “Innovative ideas in mechanism design and the attribution of social relationships will be necessary.“ The lack of ongoing verification also means that there is no mechanism by which people can be removed from the program once they pass away, but perhaps Worldcoin will add survivors’ benefits to its list of use cases and call that a feature.</span></p><p>Relatively speaking, scanning your iris and selling the account is fairly benign.

  <p>Linguistics and genetics combine to suggest a new hybrid hypothesis for the origin of the Indo-European languages</p>
  

  

  <p>An international team of linguists and geneticists led by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig has achieved a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the origins of Indo-European, a family of languages spoken by nearly half of the world’s population.</p>
  
  
<figure data-description="A hybrid hypothesis for the origin and spread of the Indo-European languages. The language family began to diverge from around 8100 years ago, out of a homeland immediately south of the Caucasus. One migration reached the Pontic-Caspian and Forest Steppe around 7000 years ago, and from there subsequent migrations spread into parts of Europe around 5000 years ago."

<p>For over two hundred years, the origin of the Indo-European languages has been disputed. Two main theories have recently dominated this debate: the ‘Steppe’ hypothesis, which proposes an origin in the Pontic-Caspian Steppe around 6000 years ago, and the ‘Anatolian’ or ‘farming’ hypothesis, suggesting an older origin tied to early agriculture around 9000 years ago. Previous phylogenetic analyses of Indo-European languages have come to conflicting conclusions about the age of the family, due to the combined effects of inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the datasets they used and limitations in the way that phylogenetic methods analyzed ancient languages.</p><p>To solve these problems, researchers from the Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology assembled an international team of over 80 language specialists to construct a new dataset of core vocabulary from 161 Indo-European languages, including 52 ancient or historical languages. This more comprehensive and balanced sampling, combined with rigorous protocols for coding lexical data, rectified the problems in the datasets used by previous studies.</p><h2>Indo-European estimated to be around 8100 years old</h2><p>The team used recently developed ancestry-enabled Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to test whether ancient written languages, such as Classical Latin and Vedic Sanskrit, were the direct ancestors of modern Romance and Indic languages, respectively. Russell Gray, Head of the Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution and senior author of the study, emphasized the care they had taken to ensure that their inferences were robust. “Our chronology is robust across a wide range of alternative phylogenetic models and sensitivity analyses”, he stated. These analyses estimate the Indo-European family to be approximately 8100 years old, with five main branches already split off by around 7000 years ago.</p><p>These results are not entirely consistent with either the Steppe or the farming hypotheses. The first author of the study, Paul Heggarty, observed that “Recent ancient DNA data suggest that the Anatolian branch of Indo-European did not emerge from the Steppe, but from further south, in or near the northern arc of the Fertile Crescent — as the earliest source of the Indo-European family. Our language family tree topology, and our lineage split dates, point to other early branches that may also have spread directly from there, not through the Steppe.”</p><h2>New insights from genetics and linguistics</h2><p>The authors of the study therefore proposed a new hybrid hypothesis for the origin of the Indo-European languages, with an ultimate homeland south of the Caucasus and a subsequent branch northwards onto the Steppe, as a secondary homeland for some branches of Indo-European entering Europe with the later Yamnaya and Corded Ware-associated expansions. “Ancient DNA and language phylogenetics thus combine to suggest that the resolution to the 200-year-old Indo-European enigma lies in a hybrid of the farming and Steppe hypotheses”, remarked Gray.</p><p>Wolfgang Haak, a Group Leader in the Department of Archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, summarizes the implications of the new study by stating, “Aside from a refined time estimate for the overall language tree, the tree topology and branching order are most critical for the alignment with key archaeological events and shifting ancestry patterns seen in the ancient human genome data. This is a huge step forward from the mutually exclusive, previous scenarios, towards a more plausible model that integrates archaeological, anthropological and genetic findings.”</p>

        <p>Today is a great day for Emacs - Emacs 29.1 has just been released<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>!
Every Emacs release is special, but I haven’t been so excited about a new version of Emacs
in ages. Why so?</p>

<p><strong>Reason #1</strong> - <a href="https://batsov.com/articles/2021/12/06/emacs-is-not-a-proper-gtk-application/">pure GTK
front-end</a>
(a.k.a. <code>pgtk</code>). This also means that now Emacs supports natively Wayland. Which in tern means that it’s easier than ever to run <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2021/12/19/using-emacs-on-windows-11-with-wsl2/">Emacs in Windows’s WSL</a>. This is huge!</p>

<p><strong>Reason #2</strong> - built-in support for the massively popular <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> via <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot">eglot</a>. <code>eglot</code> has existed for a while, but it’s nice
to see it bundled with Emacs going forward. This will certainly make Emacs better positioned to complete with “modern” editors like VS Code.</p>

<p><strong>Reason #3</strong> - built-in support for
<a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">TreeSitter</a>. This means that a few
years down the road we’ll have many Emacs major modes that are much faster, robust
and feature-rich. It’s infinitely easier to built a major mode using a real
parser instead of using regular expressions.  Lots of built-in modes have
already been updated to have a version using <code>TreeSitter</code> internally. Frankly, I
can’t think of a bigger improvement in Emacs in the almost 20 years I’ve been an
Emacs user. Exciting times ahead!</p>

<p>You can read all about the new release <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS.29">here</a>. I’ll likely write a few articles about some of the new features in the weeks and months to come. In Emacs We Trust! M-x Forever!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Feel free to share in the comments what are you most excited about.</p>

      <!-- Basic structure of an FFmpeg command -->
      <p><label for="basic-structure">Basic structure of an FFmpeg command</label>
      </p><div>
        <h5>Basic structure of an FFmpeg command</h5>
        <p>At its basis, an FFmpeg command is relatively simple. After you have installed FFmpeg (see instructions <a href="https://avpres.net/FFmpeg/#ch1" target="_blank">here</a>), the program is invoked simply by typing <code>ffmpeg</code> at the command prompt.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, each instruction that you supply to FFmpeg is actually a pair: a flag, which designates the <em>type</em> of action you want to carry out; and then the specifics of that action. Flags are always prepended with a hyphen.</p>
        <p>For example, in the instruction <code>-i <em>input_file.ext</em></code>, the <code>-i</code> flag tells FFmpeg that you are supplying an input file, and <code>input_file.ext</code> states which file it is.</p>
        <p>Likewise, in the instruction <code>-c:v prores</code>, the flag <code>-c:v</code> tells FFmpeg that you want to encode the video stream, and <code>prores</code> specifies which codec is to be used. (<code>-c:v</code> is shorthand for <code>-codec:v</code>/<code>-codec:video</code>).</p>
        <p>A very basic FFmpeg command looks like this:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>ffmpeg</dt><dd>starts the command</dd>
          <dt>-i <em>input_file.ext</em></dt><dd>path and name of the input file</dd>
          <dt><em>-flag some_action</em></dt><dd>tell FFmpeg to do something, by supplying a valid flag and action</dd>
          <dt><em>output_file.ext</em></dt><dd>path and name of the output file.<br>
            Because this is the last part of the command, the filename you type here does not have a flag designating it as the output file.</dd>
        </dl>
        
      </div>
      <!-- End Basic structure of an FFmpeg command -->

      <!-- Streaming vs. Saving -->
      <p><label for="streaming-saving">Streaming vs. Saving</label>
      </p><div>
        <h5>Streaming vs. Saving</h5>
        <p>FFplay allows you to stream created video and FFmpeg allows you to save video.</p>
        <p>The following command creates and saves a 10-second video of SMPTE bars:</p>
        <p><code>ffmpeg -f lavfi -i smptebars=size=640x480 -t 5 output_file</code></p>
        <p>This command plays and streams SMPTE bars but does not save them on the computer:</p>
        <p><code>ffplay -f lavfi smptebars=size=640x480</code></p>
        <p>The main difference is small but significant: the <code>-i</code> flag is required for FFmpeg but not required for FFplay. Additionally, the FFmpeg script needs to have <code>-t 5</code> and <code>output.mkv</code> added to specify the length of time to record and the place to save the video.</p>
        
      </div>

    <!-- Loop usage explanation -->
    <p><label for="batch-loop">Batch and Loop script usage</label>
    </p><div>
      <h5>Batch and Loop script usage</h5>
      <p><code>ffmpeg -nostdin -i <em>input_file</em> ...</code></p>
      <p>One of the frequent uses of FFmpeg is to run batch commands within loops to, for example, generate access files for an entire collection at once.</p>
      <p>When running an FFmpeg command within a loop it is often necessary to use the <code>-nostdin</code> flag prior to the input in order to ensure successful execution of the commands. This is needed to override FFmpeg's default behavior of enabling interaction on standard input which can result in errors as loop inputs are fed to the ongoing command.</p>
      
    </div>
    <!-- End loop usage explanation -->

    <!-- Codec Defaults explanation -->
    <p><label for="codec-defaults">Codec defaults</label>
    </p><div>
      <h5>Codec Defaults</h5>
      <p>Unless specified, FFmpeg will automatically set codec choices and codec parameters based off of internal defaults. These defaults are applied based on the file type used in the output (for example <code>.mov</code> or <code>.wav</code>).</p>
      <p>When creating or transcoding files with FFmpeg, it is important to consider codec settings for both audio and video, as the default options may not be desirable in your particular context. The following is a brief list of codec defaults for some common file types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>.avi</code>: Audio Codec: mp3, Video Codec: mpeg4</li>
        <li><code>.mkv</code>: Audio Codec: ac3, Video Codec: H.264</li>
        <li><code>.mov</code>: Audio Codec: AAC, Video Codec: H.264</li>
        <li><code>.mp4</code>: Audio Codec: AAC, Video Codec: H.264</li>
        <li><code>.mpg</code>: Audio Codec: mp2, Video Codec: mpeg1video</li>
        <li><code>.mxf</code>: Audio Codec: pcm_s16le, Video Codec: mpeg2video</li>
        <li><code>.wav</code>: Audio Codec: pcm_s16le (16 bit PCM)</li>
      </ul>
      
    </div>
    <!-- End Codec Defaults -->

    <!-- Filtergraph explanation -->
    <p><label for="filtergraphs">Filtergraphs</label>
    </p><div>
      <h5>Filtergraphs</h5>
      <p>Many FFmpeg commands use filters that manipulate the video or audio stream in some way: for example, <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#hflip" target="_blank">hflip</a> to horizontally flip a video, or <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#amerge-1" target="_blank">amerge</a> to merge two or more audio tracks into a single stream.</p>
      <p>The use of a filter is signaled by the flag <code>-vf</code> (video filter) or <code>-af</code> (audio filter), followed by the name and options of the filter itself. For example, take the <a href="#convert-colorspace">convert colorspace</a> command:</p>
      <p><code>ffmpeg -i <em>input_file</em> -c:v libx264 -vf colormatrix=<em>src</em>:<em>dst</em> <em>output_file</em></code>
      </p><p>Here, <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#colormatrix" target="_blank">colormatrix</a> is the filter used, with <em>src</em> and <em>dst</em> representing the source and destination colorspaces. This part following the <code>-vf</code> is a <strong>filtergraph</strong>.</p>
      <p>It is also possible to apply multiple filters to an input, which are sequenced together in the filtergraph. A chained set of filters is called a filter chain, and a filtergraph may include multiple filter chains. Filters in a filterchain are separated from each other by commas (<code>,</code>), and filterchains are separated from each other by semicolons (<code>;</code>). For example, take the <a href="#inverse-telecine">inverse telecine</a> command:</p>
      <p><code>ffmpeg -i <em>input_file</em> -c:v libx264 -vf "fieldmatch,yadif,decimate" <em>output_file</em></code></p>
      <p>Here we have a filtergraph including one filter chain, which is made up of three video filters.</p>
      <p>It is often prudent to enclose your filtergraph in quotation marks; this means that you can use spaces within the filtergraph. Using the inverse telecine example again, the following filter commands are all valid and equivalent:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>-vf fieldmatch,yadif,decimate</code></li>
        <li><code>-vf "fieldmatch,yadif,decimate"</code></li>
        <li><code>-vf "fieldmatch, yadif, decimate"</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>but <code>-vf fieldmatch, yadif, decimate</code> is not valid.</p>
      <p>The ordering of the filters is significant. Video filters are applied in the order given, with the output of one filter being passed along as the input to the next filter in the chain. In the example above, <code>fieldmatch</code> reconstructs the original frames from the inverse telecined video, <code>yadif</code> deinterlaces (this is a failsafe in case any combed frames remain, for example if the source mixes telecined and real interlaced content), and <code>decimate</code> deletes duplicated frames. Clearly, it is not possible to delete duplicated frames before those frames are reconstructed.</p>
      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><code>-vf</code> is an alias for <code>-filter:v</code></li>
        <li>If the command involves more than one input or output, you must use the flag <code>-filter_complex</code> instead of <code>-vf</code>.</li>
        <li>Straight quotation marks ("like this") rather than curved quotation marks (“like this”) should be used.</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <!-- End Filtergraph explanation -->

    <!-- Stream mapping explanation -->
    <p><label for="stream-mapping">Stream mapping</label>
    </p><div>
      <h5>Stream mapping</h5>
      <p>Stream mapping is the practice of defining which of the streams (e.g., video or audio tracks) present in an input file will be present in the output file. FFmpeg recognizes five stream types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>a</code> - audio</li>
        <li><code>v</code> - video</li>
        <li><code>s</code> - subtitle</li>
        <li><code>d</code> - data (including timecode tracks)</li>
        <li><code>t</code> - attachment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mapping is achieved by use of the <code>-map</code> flag, followed by an action of the type <code>file_number:stream_type[:stream_number]</code>. Numbering is zero-indexed, and it's possible to map by stream type and/or overall stream order within the input file. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>-map 0:v</code> means ‘take all video streams from the first input file’.</li>
        <li><code>-map 0:3</code> means ‘take the fourth stream from the first input file’.</li>
        <li><code>-map 0:a:2</code> means ‘take the third audio stream from the first input file’.</li>
        <li><code>-map 0:0 -map 0:2</code> means ‘take the first and third streams from the first input file’.</li>
        <li><code>-map 0:1 -map 1:0</code> means ‘take the second stream from the first input file and the first stream from the second input file’.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When no mapping is specified in an ffmpeg command, the default for video files is to take just one video and one audio stream for the output: other stream types, such as timecode or subtitles, will not be copied to the output file by default. If multiple video or audio streams are present, the best quality one is automatically selected by FFmpeg.</p>
      <p>To map <em>all</em> streams in the input file to the output file, use <code>-map 0</code>. However, note that not all container formats can include all stream types: for example, .mp4 cannot contain timecode.</p>
      <h4>Mapping with a failsafe</h4>
      <p>To safely process files that may or may not contain given a type of stream, you can add a trailing <code>?</code> to your map commands: for example, <code>-map 0:a?</code> instead of <code>-map 0:a</code>.</p>
      <p>This makes the map optional: audio streams will be mapped over if they are present in the file—but if the file contains no audio streams, the transcode will proceed as usual, minus the audio stream mapping. Without adding the trailing <code>?</code>, FFmpeg will exit with an error on that file.</p>
      <p>This is especially recommended when batch processing video files: it ensures that all files in your batch will be transcoded, whether or not they contain audio streams.</p>
      <p>For more information, check out the FFmpeg wiki <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Map" target="_blank">Map</a> page, and the official FFmpeg <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Advanced-options" target="_blank">documentation on <code>-map</code></a>.</p>

    <h2 id="rewrap">Change container (rewrap)</h2>

    <!-- Basic rewrap command -->
    <p><label for="basic-rewrap">Basic rewrap command</label>
    </p><div>
      <h5>Rewrap a file</h5>
      <p><code>ffmpeg -i <em>input_file.ext</em> -c copy -map 0 <em>output_file.ext</em></code></p>
      <p>This script will rewrap a video file. It will create a new video video file where the inner content (the video, audio, and subtitle data) of the original file is unchanged, but these streams are rehoused within a different container format.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> rewrapping is also known as remuxing, short for re-multiplexing.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>ffmpeg</dt><dd>starts the command</dd>
        <dt>-i <em>input_file.ext</em></dt><dd>path and name of the input file</dd>
        <dt>-c copy</dt><dd>copy the streams directly, without re-encoding.</dd>
        <dt>-map 0</dt><dd>map all streams of the input to the output.<br>
        By default, FFmpeg will only map one stream of each type (video, audio, subtitles) to the output file. However, files may have multiple streams of a given type - for example, a video may have several audio tracks for different languages. Therefore, if you want to preserve all the streams in the original, it's necessary to use this option.</dd>
        <dt><em>output_file.ext</em></dt><dd>path and name of the output file.<br>
        The new container you are rewrapping to is defined by the filename extension used here, e.g. .mkv, .mp4, .mov.</dd>
      </dl>
      <h4>Important caveat</h4>
      <p>It may not be possible to rewrap a file's contents to a new container without re-encoding one or more of the streams within (that is, the video, audio, and subtitle tracks). Some containers can only contain streams of a certain encoding type: for example, the .mp4 container does not support uncompressed audio tracks. (In practice .mp4 goes hand-in-hand with a H.264-encoded video stream and an AAC-encoded video stream, although other types of video and audio streams are possible). Another example is that the Matroska container does not allow data tracks; see the <a href="#mkv-to-mp4">MKV to MP4 recipe</a>.</p>
      <p>In such cases, FFmpeg will throw an error. If you encounter errors of this kind, you may wish to consult the <a href="#transcode">list of transcoding recipes</a>.</p>

      </dl>
      <p>Notes: You can choose which fields to write by repeating <code>-metadata field_name='Content'</code> for each desired field. Flags for commonly used fields (such as those recommended by the <a href="http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/audio-visual/documents/Embed_Guideline_20120423.pdf">FADGI guidelines</a>) are as follows:</p>
      <ul>

      <p>Example: <code>-metadata originator='US, UW Libraries'</code></p>
      <p>Additionally, users should be aware that BWF metadata fields are limited by characters, with some such as OriginatorReference maxing out at 32.

      <p>This command takes an input file and transcodes it to H.264 with an .mp4 wrapper, audio is transcoded to AAC. The libx264 codec defaults to a “medium” preset for compression quality and a CRF of 23. CRF stands for constant rate factor and determines the quality and file size of the resulting H.264 video.

      <p>In order to optimize the file for streaming, you can add this preset:</p>

      </dl>
      <p>In order to use the same basic command to make a higher quality file, you can add some of these presets:</p>
      <p><code>ffmpeg -i <em>input_file</em> -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -preset veryslow -crf 18 -c:a aac <em>output_file</em></code></p>

        <dt>-crf <em>18</em></dt><dd>Specifying a lower CRF will make a larger file with better visual quality. For H.264 files being encoded with a 4:2:0 chroma subsampling scheme (i.e., using <code>-pix_fmt yuv420p</code>), the scale ranges between 0-51 for 8-bit content, with 0 being lossless and 51 the worst possible quality.<br>
          If no crf is specified, <code>libx264</code> will use a default value of 23. 18 is often considered a “visually lossless” compression.</dd>

      <p>This command takes an input file and transcodes it to H.264 using the encoding functionality of an Nvidia GPU (without transcoding the audio). If you're using H.264 with AAC or AC3 audio, you can output to an .mp4 file; if you're using HEVC and/or more exotic audio, you should output to .mkv. While Nvidia's fixed-function hardware can be 10x as performant as encoding on the CPU, it requires a few more parameters in order to optimize quality at lower bitrates.</p>

      <p>Values that are set to 'unknown' and 'undetermined' may be unspecified within the stream. An unknown aspect ratio would be expressed as '0:1'. Streams with many unknown properties may have interoperability issues or not play as intended. In many cases, an unknown or undetermined value may be accurate because the information about the source is unclear, but often the value is intended to be known. In many cases the stream will played with an assumed value if undetermined (for instance a display_aspect_ratio of '0:1' may be played as 'WIDTH:HEIGHT'), but this may or may not be what is intended. Use carefully.</p>

      <p><code>ffmpeg -f concat -i mylist.txt -c copy <em>output_file</em></code></p>
      <p>This command takes two or more files of the same file type and joins them together to make a single file. All that the program needs is a text file with a list specifying the files that should be joined. If possible, run the command from the same directory where the files and the text file reside. Otherwise you'll have to use <code>-safe 0</code>, see below for more information. However, it only works properly if the files to be combined have the exact same codec and technical specifications. Be careful, FFmpeg may appear to have successfully joined two video files with different codecs, but may only bring over the audio from the second file or have other weird behaviors. Don’t use this command for joining files with different codecs and technical specs and always preview your resulting video file!</p>

Per the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html#Options" target="_blank">FFmpeg documentation</a>, it is preferable to specify relative rather than absolute file paths, as allowing absolute file paths may pose a security risk.<br>

  file '<em>last_file.ext</em>'
</pre>
  In the above, <strong>file</strong> is simply the word "file". Straight apostrophes ('like this') rather than curved quotation marks (‘like this’) must be used to enclose the file paths.<br>
  <strong>Note:</strong> If specifying absolute file paths in the .txt file, add <code>-safe 0</code> before the input file.<br>

      <p>This command takes two or more files of the different file types and joins them together to make a single file.</p>
      <p>The input files may differ in many respects - container, codec, chroma subsampling scheme, framerate, etc. However, the above command only works properly if the files to be combined have the same dimensions (e.g., 720x576). Also note that if the input files have different framerates, then the output file will be of variable framerate.</p>
      <p>Some aspects of the input files will be normalized: for example, if an input file contains a video track and an audio track that do not have exactly the same duration, the shorter one will be padded. In the case of a shorter video track, the last frame will be repeated in order to cover the missing video; in the case of a shorter audio track, the audio stream will be padded with silence.</p>

      </dl>
      <p>If no characteristics of the output files are specified, ffmpeg will use the default encodings associated with the given output file type. To specify the characteristics of the output stream(s), add flags after each <code>-map "[out]"</code> part of the command.</p>
      <p>For example, to ensure that the video stream of the output file is visually lossless H.264 with a 4:2:0 chroma subsampling scheme, the command above could be amended to include the following:<br>
        <code>-map "[video_out]" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -preset veryslow -crf 18</code></p>
      <p>Likewise, to encode the output audio stream as mp3, the command could include the following:<br>
        <code>-map "[audio_out]" -c:a libmp3lame -dither_method triangular -qscale:a 2</code></p>
      <h4>Variation: concatenating files of different resolutions</h4>
      <p>To concatenate files of different resolutions, you need to resize the videos to have matching resolutions prior to concatenation. The most basic way to do this is by using a scale filter and giving the dimensions of the file you wish to match:</p>
      <p><code>-vf scale=1920:1080:flags=lanczos</code></p>
      <p>(The Lanczos scaling algorithm is recommended, as it is slower but better than the default bilinear algorithm).</p>
      <p>The rescaling should be applied just before the point where the streams to be used in the output file are listed. Select the stream you want to rescale, apply the filter, and assign that to a variable name (<code>rescaled_video</code> in the below example). Then you use this variable name in the list of streams to be concatenated.</p>
      <p><code>ffmpeg -i input_1.avi -i input_2.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v:0] scale=1920:1080:flags=lanczos [rescaled_video], [rescaled_video] [0:a:0] [1:v:0] [1:a:0] concat=n=2:v=1:a=1 [video_out] [audio_out]" -map "[video_out]" -map "[audio_out]" <em>output_file</em></code></p>
      <p>However, this will only have the desired visual output if the inputs have the same aspect ratio. If you wish to concatenate an SD and an HD file, you will also wish to pillarbox the SD file while upscaling. (See the <a href="#SD_HD_2">Convert 4:3 to pillarboxed HD</a> command). The full command would look like this:</p>
      <p><code>ffmpeg -i input_1.avi -i input_2.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v:0] scale=1440:1080:flags=lanczos, pad=1920:1080:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2 [to_hd_video], [to_hd_video] [0:a:0] [1:v:0] [1:a:0] concat=n=2:v=1:a=1 [video_out] [audio_out]" -map "[video_out]" -map "[audio_out]" <em>output_file</em></code></p>
      <p>Here, the first input is an SD file which needs to be upscaled to match the second input, which is 1920x1080. The scale filter enlarges the SD input to the height of the HD frame, keeping the 4:3 aspect ratio; then, the video is pillarboxed within a 1920x1080 frame.</p>
      <h4>Variation: concatenating files of different framerates</h4>
      <p>If the input files have different framerates, then the output file may be of variable framerate. To explicitly obtain an output file of constant framerate, you may wish convert an input (or multiple inputs) to a different framerate prior to concatenation.</p>
      <p>You can speed up or slow down a file using the <code>fps</code> and <code>atempo</code> filters (see also the <a href="#modify_speed">Modify speed</a> command).</p>
      <p>Here's an example of the full command, in which input_1 is 30fps, input_2 is 25fps, and 25fps is the desired output speed.</p>
      <p><code>ffmpeg -i input_1.avi -i input_2.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v:0] fps=fps=25 [video_to_25fps]; [0:a:0] atempo=(25/30) [audio_to_25fps]; [video_to_25fps] [audio_to_25fps] [1:v:0] [1:a:0] concat=n=2:v=1:a=1 [video_out] [audio_out]" -map "[video_out]" -map "[audio_out]" <em>output_file</em></code></p>
      <p>Note that the <code>fps</code> filter will drop or repeat frames as necessary in order to achieve the desired frame rate - see the FFmpeg <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#fps-1" target="_blank">fps docs</a> for more details.</p>

      <p><code>ffmpeg -ss HH:MM:SS -i <em>input_file</em> -filter_complex "fps=10,scale=500:-1:flags=lanczos,palettegen" -t 3 <em>palette.png</em></code></p>

      <p>The first command will use the palettegen filter to create a custom palette, then the second command will create the GIF with the paletteuse filter. The result is a high quality GIF.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>ffmpeg</dt><dd>starts the command</dd>

        <dt>-filter_complex "fps=<em>framerate</em>, scale=<em>width</em>:<em>height</em>, palettegen"</dt><dd>a complex filtergraph.<br>
        Firstly, the fps filter sets the frame rate.<br>
        Then the scale filter resizes the image. You can specify both the width and the height, or specify a value for one and use a scale value of <em>-1</em> for the other to preserve the aspect ratio. (For example, <code>500:-1</code> would create a GIF 500 pixels wide and with a height proportional to the original video). In the first script above, <code>:flags=lanczos</code> specifies that the Lanczos rescaling algorithm will be used to resize the image.<br>
        Lastly, the palettegen filter generates the palette.</dd>
        <dt>-t <em>3</em></dt><dd>duration in seconds (here 3; can be specified also with a full timestamp, i.e. here 00:00:03)</dd>
        <dt>-loop <em>6</em></dt><dd>sets the number of times to loop the GIF. A value of <em>-1</em> will disable looping. Omitting <em>-loop</em> will use the default, which will loop infinitely.</dd>
        <dt><em>output_file</em></dt><dd>path, name and extension of the output file</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>The second command has a slightly different filtergraph, which breaks down as follows:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>-filter_complex "[0:v]fps=10, scale=500:-1:flags=lanczos[v], [v][1:v]paletteuse"</dt><dd><code>[0:v]fps=10,scale=500:-1:flags=lanczos[v]</code>: applies the fps and scale filters described above to the first input file (the video).<br>
        <code>[v][1:v]paletteuse"</code>: applies the <code>paletteuse</code> filter, setting the second input file (the palette) as the reference file.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Simpler GIF creation</p>
      <p><code>ffmpeg -ss HH:MM:SS -i <em>input_file</em> -vf "fps=10,scale=500:-1" -t 3 -loop 6 <em>output_file</em></code></p>
      <p>This is a quick and easy method. Dithering is more apparent than the above method using the palette filters, but the file size will be smaller. Perfect for that “legacy” GIF look.</p>

      <h5>Create Bash script to batch process with FFmpeg</h5>
      <p>Bash scripts are plain text files saved with a .sh extension. This entry explains how they work with the example of a bash script named “Rewrap-MXF.sh”, which rewraps .mxf files in a given directory to .mov files.</p>
      <p>“Rewrap-MXF.sh” contains the following text:</p>
      <p><code>for file in *.mxf; do ffmpeg -i "$file" -map 0 -c copy "${file%.mxf}.mov"; done</code></p>
      <dl>
        <dt>for file in *.mxf</dt><dd>starts the loop, and states what the input files will be. Here, the FFmpeg command within the loop will be applied to all files with an extension of .mxf.<br>
        The word ‘file’ is an arbitrary variable which will represent each .mxf file in turn as it is looped over.</dd>
        <dt>do ffmpeg -i "$file"</dt><dd>carry out the following FFmpeg command for each input file.<br>
        Per Bash syntax, within the command the variable is referred to by <strong>“$file”</strong>. The dollar sign is used to reference the variable ‘file’, and the enclosing quotation marks prevents reinterpretation of any special characters that may occur within the filename, ensuring that the original filename is retained.</dd>
        <dt>-map 0</dt><dd>retain all streams</dd>
        <dt>-c copy</dt><dd>enable stream copy (no re-encode)</dd>
        <dt>"${file%.mxf}.mov";</dt><dd>retaining the original file name, set the output file wrapper as .mov</dd>
        <dt>done</dt><dd>complete; all items have been processed.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> the shell script (.sh file) and all .mxf files to be processed must be contained within the same directory, and the script must be run from that directory.<br>
        Execute the .sh file with the command <code>sh Rewrap-MXF.sh</code>.</p>
      <p>Modify the script as needed to perform different transcodes, or to use with ffprobe. :)</p>
      <p>The basic pattern will look similar to this:<br>
      <code>for item in *.ext; do ffmpeg -i $item <em>(FFmpeg options here)</em> "${item%.ext}_suffix.ext"</code></p>
      <p>e.g., if an input file is bestmovie002.avi, its output will be bestmovie002_suffix.avi.</p>
      <p>Variation: recursively process all MXF files in subdirectories using <code>find</code> instead of <code>for</code>:</p>
      <p><code>find input_directory -iname "*.mxf" -exec ffmpeg -i {} -map 0 -c copy {}.mov \;</code></p>

      <h5>Create PowerShell script to batch process with FFmpeg</h5>
      <p>As of Windows 10, it is possible to run Bash via <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about" target="_blank">Bash on Ubuntu on Windows</a>, allowing you to use <a href="#batch_processing_bash">bash scripting</a>. To enable Bash on Windows, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide" target="_blank">these instructions</a>.</p>
      <p>On Windows, the primary native command line program is <strong>PowerShell</strong>. PowerShell scripts are plain text files saved with a .ps1 extension. This entry explains how they work with the example of a PowerShell script named “rewrap-mp4.ps1”, which rewraps .mp4 files in a given directory to .mkv files.</p>
      <p>“rewrap-mp4.ps1” contains the following text:</p>
      <pre><code>$inputfiles = ls *.mp4
  foreach ($file in $inputfiles) {
  $output = [io.path]::ChangeExtension($file, '.mkv')
  ffmpeg -i $file -map 0 -c copy $output
  }</code></pre>
      <dl>
        <dt>$inputfiles = ls *.mp4</dt><dd>Creates the variable <code>$inputfiles</code>, which is a list of all the .mp4 files in the current folder.<br>
        In PowerShell, all variable names start with the dollar-sign character.</dd>
        <dt>foreach ($file in $inputfiles)</dt><dd>Creates a loop and states the subsequent code block will be applied to each file listed in <code>$inputfiles</code>.<br>
        <code>$file</code> is an arbitrary variable which will represent each .mp4 file in turn as it is looped over.</dd>
        <dt>{</dt><dd>Opens the code block.</dd>
        <dt>$output = [io.path]::ChangeExtension($file, '.mkv')</dt><dd>Sets up the output file: it will be located in the current folder and keep the same filename, but will have an .mkv extension instead of .mp4.</dd>
        <dt>ffmpeg -i $file</dt><dd>Carry out the following FFmpeg command for each input file.<br>
        <strong>Note:</strong> To call FFmpeg here as just ‘ffmpeg’ (rather than entering the full path to ffmpeg.exe), you must make sure that it’s correctly configured. See <a href="http://adaptivesamples.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/" target="_blank">this article</a>, especially the section ‘Add to Path’.</dd>

        <dt>}</dt><dd>Closes the code block.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> the PowerShell script (.ps1 file) and all .mp4 files to be rewrapped must be contained within the same directory, and the script must be run from that directory.</p>
      <p>Execute the .ps1 file by typing <code>.\rewrap-mp4.ps1</code> in PowerShell.</p>

      <p>This will create an MD5 checksum for each group of 48000 audio samples.<br>
        The number of samples per group can be set arbitrarily, but it's good practice to match the samplerate of the media file (so you will get one checksum per second).</p>
      <p>Examples for other samplerates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>44.1 kHz: "asetnsamples=n=44100"</li>
        <li>96 kHz: "asetnsamples=n=96000"</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This filter transcodes audio to 16 bit PCM by default. The generated framemd5s will represent this value. Validating these framemd5s will require using the same default settings. Alternatively, when your file has another quantization rates (e.g. 24 bit), then you might add the audio codec <code>-c:a pcm_s24le</code> to the command, for compatibility reasons with other tools, like <a href="https://mediaarea.net/BWFMetaEdit" target="_blank">BWF MetaEdit</a>.</p>

      </p><div>
        <h5>Find Drive Offset for Exact CD Ripping</h5>
        <p>If you want to make CD rips that can be verified via checksums to other rips of the same content, you need to know the offset of your CD drive. Put simply, different models of CD drives have different offsets, meaning they start reading in slightly different locations. This must be compensated for in order for files created on different (model) drives to generate the same checksum. For a more detailed explanation of drive offsets see the explanation <a href="https://dbpoweramp.com/spoons-audio-guide-cd-ripping.htm" target="_blank">here.</a> In order to find your drive offset, first you will need to know exactly what model your drive is, then you can look it up in the list of drive offsets by Accurate Rip.</p>
        <p>Often it can be difficult to tell what model your drive is simply by looking at it - it may be housed inside your computer or have external branding that is different from the actual drive manufacturer. For this reason, it can be useful to query your drive with CD ripping software in order to ID it. The following commands should give you a better idea of what drive you have.</p>
        <p><strong>Cdda2wav:</strong> <code>cdda2wav -scanbus</code> or simply <code>cdda2wav</code></p>
        <p><strong>CD Paranoia:</strong> <code>cdparanoia -vsQ</code></p>
        <p>Once you have IDed your drive, you can search the <a href="http://www.accuraterip.com/driveoffsets.htm">Accurate Rip CD drive offset list</a> to find the correct offset for your drive as sourced by the community.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> A very effective GUI based tool (macOS specific) for both for discovering drive offset as well as accurately ripping CDDAs is <a href="https://tmkk.undo.jp/xld/index_e.html">XLD</a>.

        <p>Cdda2wav is a tool that uses the <a href="https://www.xiph.org/paranoia/">Paranoia library</a> to facilitate accurate ripping of audio CDs (CDDA). It can be installed via Homebrew with the command <code> brew install cdrtools</code>. This command will accurately rip an audio CD into a single wave file, while querying the CDDB database for track information and creating a cue sheet. This cue sheet can then be used either for playback of the WAV file or to split it into individual access files. Any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-Text">cdtext</a> information that is discovered will be stored as a sidecar. For more information about cue sheets see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_sheet_(computing)">this Wikipedia article.</a></p>
        <p><strong>Notes: </strong>On macOS the CD must be unmounted before this command is run. This can be done with the command <code>sudo umount '/Volumes/Name_of_CD'</code></p>
        <p>As of writing, when using the default Homebrew installed version of Cdda2wav some drives will falsely report errors on all rips. If this is occurring, a possible solution is to use the command <code>brew install --devel cdrtools</code> to install a more recent build that incorporates a fix.</p>

        </p><div>
          <h5>Check/Compensate for CD Emphasis</h5>
          <p>While somewhat rare, certain CDs had 'emphasis' applied as a form of noise reduction. This seems to mostly affect early (1980s) era CDs and some CDs pressed in Japan. Emphasis is part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc_Digital_Audio#Standard">Red Book standard</a> and, if present, must be compensated for to ensure accurate playback. CDs that use emphasis contain flags on tracks that tell the CD player to de-emphasize the audio on playback. When ripping a CD with emphasis, it is important to take this into account and either apply de-emphasis while ripping, or if storing a 'flat' copy, create another de-emphasized listening copy.</p>
          <p>The following commands will output information about the presence of emphasis when run on a target CD:</p>
          <p><strong>Cdda2wav:</strong> <code>cdda2wav -J</code></p>
          <p><strong>CD Paranoia:</strong> <code>cdparanoia -Q</code></p>
          <p>In order to compensate for emphasis during ripping while using Cdda2wav, the <code>-T</code> flag can be added to the <a href="#cdda2wav">standard ripping command</a>. For a recipe to compensate for a flat rip, see the section on <a href="#cd_eq">de-emphasizing with FFmpeg</a>.

        <p>Another great resource with lots of supplemental explanations of filters is available at <a href="http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/index.php" target="_blank">Fred's ImageMagick Scripts</a>.</p>
        <p>Unlike many other command line tools, ImageMagick isn't summoned by calling its name. Rather, ImageMagick installs links to several more specific commands: <code>convert</code>, <code>montage</code>, and <code>mogrify</code>, to name a few.</p>

        <h5>About flac tool</h5>
        <p>The flac tool is the tool created by the FLAC project to transcode to/from FLAC and to manipulate metadata in FLAC files. One advantage it has over other tools used to transcode into FLAC is the capability of embedding foreign metadata (such as BWF metadata). This means that it is possible to compress a BWF file into FLAC and maintain the ability to transcode back into an identical BWF, metadata and all. For a more detailed explanation, see <a href="http://dericed.com/2013/flac-in-the-archives/" target="_blank">Dave Rice's article</a> on the topic, from which the following commands are adapted.</p>
        <h3>Transcode to FLAC</h3>
        <p>Use this command to transcode from WAV to FLAC while maintaining BWF metadata</p>
        <p><code>flac --best --keep-foreign-metadata --preserve-modtime --verify <em>input.wav</em></code></p>
        <dl>
          <dt>flac</dt><dd>starts the command</dd>
          <dt>-i <em>input_file.ext</em></dt><dd>path and name of the input file</dd>
          <dt>--best</dt><dd>sets the file for the most efficient compression (resulting in a smaller file at the expense of a slower process).</dd>
          <dt>--keep-foreign-metadata</dt><dd>tells the flac tool to maintain original metadata within the FLAC file.</dd>
          <dt>--preserve-modtime</dt><dd>preserves the file timestamps of the input file.</dd>
          <dt>--verify</dt><dd>verifies the validity of the output file.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h3>Transcode from FLAC</h3>
        <p>Use this command to transcode from FLAC to reconstruct original BWF file. Command is the same as the prior command with the exception of substituting <code>--decode</code> for <code>best</code> and changing the input to a <code>.flac</code> file.</p>
        <p><code>flac --decode --keep-foreign-metadata --preserve-modtime --verify <em>input.flac</em></code></p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">Once a week, a little past noon on Wednesdays, a line of cars forms outside the wrought-iron gates of the Carolands mansion, 20 miles south of downtown San Francisco. From the entrance, you can see the southeast facade of the 98-room Beaux Arts chateau, which was built a century ago by an heiress to the Pullman railroad-car fortune. Not visible from that vantage point is the stately reflecting pool, or the gardens, whose original designer took inspiration from Versailles.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">I was sitting just outside this splendor, idling in my rented Toyota Corolla, on a clear day last winter. Like the other people in the line of cars, I was about to enjoy a rare treat. Carolands is an architectural landmark, but it’s open only two hours a week. Would-be visitors apply a month in advance, hoping to win a lottery for tickets. Like most lotteries, this one has long odds. I had applied unsuccessfully for the three tours scheduled for February. Finally, I resorted to my journalist’s privilege: I emailed and called the director of the foundation that owns the estate, explaining that I was a reporter planning to be in the area for a few days. Could she help? Eventually, she called back and offered me a place on a tour.</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">It wasn’t supposed to be this difficult. When billionaire Charles Johnson sought a tax break in 2013 for donating his mansion to his private foundation, the organization assured the Internal Revenue Service and state officials that the public would be welcome. “The Foundation will fulfill its charitable and educational purpose by opening the Carolands Estate to the public,” it stated in its <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23879863-carolands_1023_public#document/p16/a2365104">application for tax-exempt status</a>, which included a pamphlet for a self-guided tour. The foundation later told a California tax regulator that the estate was <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23885843-carolands-california-boe-277-public#document/p38/a2365102">open to the public every weekday from 9-5</a>.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">There was a lot of money at stake. Johnson, a Republican megadonor and part owner of the San Francisco Giants, had gotten an appraisal valuing the property at $130 million, a price higher than any publicly reported home sale in the U.S. up to that time, and five times the $26 million he and his wife, Ann, had reportedly paid 14 years earlier to buy and restore what then was a dilapidated property.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">The plan worked. The IRS granted the foundation tax-exempt status. That allowed the Johnsons to collect more than $38 million in tax savings from the estate over five years, confidential tax records show.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">But the Johnsons never opened Carolands to the public for 40 hours a week. Instead, the foundation bestows tickets on a few dozen lottery winners, who receive two-hour tours, led by docents, most Wednesdays at 1 p.m. Self-guided tours, like the ones described in the attachments to Johnson’s IRS application, are not offered. “It sounds like a vanity project with little to no public benefit,” said Roger Colinvaux, a professor of law at The Catholic University of America who specializes in the tax law of nonprofit organizations. (Experts also questioned Carolands’ $130 million valuation — which turbocharged the Johnsons’ deduction — while acknowledging that as long as it’s based on a qualified appraisal, which it was, the IRS is unlikely to challenge the size of the deduction.)</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">For the ultrawealthy, donating valuables like artwork, real estate and stocks to their own charitable foundation is an alluring way to cut their tax bills. In exchange for generous tax breaks, they are supposed to use the assets to serve the public: Art might be put on display where people can see it, or stock sold to fund programs to fight child poverty. Across the U.S., such foundations <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL164090015Q">hold over $1 trillion in assets</a>.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">But a ProPublica investigation reveals that some foundation donors have obtained millions of dollars in tax deductions without holding up their end of the bargain, and sometimes they personally benefit from donations that are supposed to be a boon to the public. A tech billionaire used his charitable foundation to buy his girlfriend’s house, then stayed there with her while he was going through a divorce. A real estate mogul keeps his nonprofit art museum in his guesthouse and told ProPublica that he hadn’t shown it to a member of the public since before the pandemic. And a venture capitalist couple’s foundation bought the multimillion dollar house next to their own without ever opening the property to the public.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Unlike public charities, private foundations are typically funded by a single donor or family, who retain a high degree of control long after receiving a tax break for ostensibly giving their possessions away. “This is the classic problem with private foundations: Substantial contributors can see it as their thing,” said Philip Hackney, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh and former IRS attorney. “There’s generally not a coalition who cares, other than the family, so there’s nothing to ensure that the assets are used for a particular purpose,” he added.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">In theory, it’s illegal to fail to provide a public benefit or to make personal use of foundation assets. But the rules defining what’s in the public interest are vague, according to tax experts; for example, Congress has never defined how many hours a museum would need to be open to be considered accessible to the public. And with the IRS depleted by a decade of budget cuts, enforcement has been lax. The agency examines an average of 225 returns among the 100,000 filed by private foundations each year, according to agency statistics.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">Peter Kanter, an attorney representing the Carolands Foundation, told ProPublica that “we believe pretty strongly that the foundation is serving its purpose of preserving and showcasing this historic and unique property to the public.” He said that tours are limited because the foundation has only a few volunteer docents who are knowledgeable about the home, and because significantly higher traffic might compromise the foundation’s ability to preserve its unique architecture. Kanter also emphasized the public value of free charitable events that the foundation occasionally hosts for other nonprofits at the estate.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">At the Carolands, guides didn’t emphasize benefits to the public — just the opposite. A docent told my tour group that the foundation prefers lotteries to holding regular hours and charging admission. This, he explained, preserves the home for those who “really want to see it.” Indeed, exclusivity and rarefied taste were a theme of the tour, which included tales of the exacting specifications of Harriett Carolan, the Pullman heiress, a Francophile who imported an entire salon that had been built in France on the eve of the revolution. (For their parts, when Ann and Charles Johnson unveiled the restored chateau at a costume party, they dressed as Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">Before the tour, one of the docents asked how many of us had ever visited a nearby historical mansion, called the Filoli estate, built in the same era as the Carolands. Many hands shot up among the tour group. When he asked if any of us had visited the Carolands before, no one raised their hand.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">Curious, I popped by Filoli the following afternoon. It is run by a public charity and is open from 10 to 5 every day. In contrast to the Carolands, I was able to simply show up, pay admission and enter. Inside, I encountered dozens of employees who provided helpful information and watched over the manor and its gardens while more than a hundred visitors wandered about. Photography, which had been prohibited inside the Carolands, was permitted at Filoli.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">Congress and the IRS have never clearly defined what qualifies as a “public benefit.” By contrast, identifying a private benefit is much simpler. Decades ago Congress prohibited what it called self-dealing by insiders. The laws are designed to keep them from using or profiting from foundation assets. Among other things, the rules bar leases between a donor and their foundation. Violations can incur a penalty known as an excise tax.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">At least one billionaire appears to have run afoul of those real estate rules, according to tax experts. Since 2009, Ken Xie, CEO of a cybersecurity company called Fortinet, has gotten more than $30 million in income tax deductions for contributing shares of his business to a private foundation that he started to support various charitable causes.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">In 2017, Xie’s foundation (whose <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/271208110/202233059349101733/full">sole officers are Xie and his brother</a>) spent $3 million to purchase a home in Cupertino, California, from his new girlfriend while he was going through an acrimonious divorce. After the foundation purchased the home, Xie allowed his girlfriend to continue living there; he also stayed there for a time. These details emerged in a lawsuit filed by the now-ex-girlfriend, who was permitted to file the suit anonymously, in county court. (The suit is ongoing.) According to leases filed in the case, the foundation charged her rent, but Xie agreed to pay half of it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Xie himself appears to have been aware that he risked violating the rules. In a December 2019 text message to his girlfriend that was included in the court case, Xie wrote, “I covered some house part but also try not creat issue related to foundation and tax, believe will make some progress next few months by transfer house out of foundation, may need 2 step by first transfer to other entity.” The next month, his foundation transferred the property to an LLC.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">In an email to ProPublica, Gordon Finwall, a lawyer for Xie, said the foundation is “fully committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations.” He acknowledged that Xie “spent some time at the Cupertino property in 2017 and 2018,” but asserted that the sublease was never in effect and Xie never paid his ex-girlfriend any rent.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">Two days after I emailed Finwall in April inquiring about the Xie Foundation’s purchase of the house, the foundation <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23882476-xie_foundation_2017_amendment#document/p2/a2363407">filed records with the California attorney general’s office</a>, stating that it had “discovered a self-dealing event” and including a federal tax return with the word “amended” handwritten at the top. In his email to ProPublica, Finwall said that, after amending its returns, the foundation “paid some excise taxes related to Mr. Xie’s stay at the property.” Finwall also said that Xie had planned to file the amended returns months earlier but didn’t do so because his accountant mailed the IRS forms to Xie at an outdated address.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">Despite the blurriness of many rules relating to foundations, the issue of public access has given rise to controversy in the past. After a New York Times article in 2015 exposed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/business/art-collectors-gain-tax-benefits-from-private-museums.html">limited hours of many private museums</a>, the Senate Finance Committee, under then-chairman Orrin Hatch, launched an investigation. <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/hatch-concludes-review-into-tax-exempt-private-museums-notes-concerning-findings">Hatch expressed concerns</a> about museums that require advance reservations and maintain limited public hours. He questioned instances where “founding donors continue to play an active role in management and operations of the museum” and “museum buildings are adjacent to the donor’s private residence.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">But no meaningful rule changes followed the investigation. And absent new laws, cracking down on abusive foundations would require the IRS to put scarce resources into an area that many experts said simply isn’t a priority, particularly after the agency’s previous attempt to police abuse by political nonprofits a decade ago caused a conservative firestorm.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">The agency doesn’t appear likely to increase oversight any time soon. A recently published budget blueprint outlining IRS priorities for the $80 billion in new funding it received from the Inflation Reduction Act made no mention of increasing audits of private foundations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">“The IRS protects the public interest by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all,” the agency wrote in a statement to ProPublica. The statement cited a compliance program that “focuses on high-risk issues” among tax-exempt organizations, and it asserted that the program “deploys the right resources to address noncompliance issues.” The IRS also pointed to a recent tax court case that it won against a foundation that, among other things, kept a collection of African artifacts in a basement with no public access. And an agency spokesperson highlighted a rule stating that foundations can lose their exempt status if they operate in a manner “materially different” than what they claimed they would do in their initial application.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Despite the attention spurred by the Hatch investigation, some foundations seem to have continued undeterred. Consider the Lijin Gouhua Foundation. Collecting Chinese paintings and sharing them with the public was the stated mission of the organization, which was launched by Bay Area venture capitalists J. Sanford “Sandy” Miller and his then-wife, Vinie Zhang Miller, in 2006. Since then, the couple generated $5.6 million worth of income tax write-offs largely from donating shares of tech companies like Twitter and Snapchat to their private foundation.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">When the couple cashed in the foundation’s stock to buy a potential museum space for the art in 2017, they opted against a high-traffic location where lots of people could easily access it. Instead, they chose <a href="https://www.redfin.com/CA/Woodside/1540-Portola-Rd-94062/home/2009633">the $3.1 million house</a> adjacent to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBpp_3YhK_0">their own estate in Woodside</a>, an exclusive enclave outside of San Francisco.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">“A private museum is usually by appointment only,” Vinie Miller said when asked about the out-of-the-way location. “We wouldn’t hold long showing hours. It’s usually people we have a relationship with.” She said that the main way for the public to access the collection was through loans of artwork the foundation has made to universities, other museums and galleries. (In an email, Sandy Miller wrote: “Please be advised that I am not married to Vinie and that I have no involvement with the Lijin Gouhua Foundation.” Public records show Vinie filed for divorce from him in 2019; Sandy ceased to be listed as president of the foundation on IRS filings that year as well.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">The museum that was purchased with the foundation’s tax-exempt funds never actually opened. Vinie Miller said the plan was “hypothetical” and that the foundation held the home as an investment instead. That’s at odds with the foundation’s publicly available tax returns, which have listed the property as being used for charitable purposes. (Miller did not respond to a follow-up question asking about the discrepancy between her statements and the foundation’s tax returns.) As Colinvaux, the specialist in nonprofits, put it, “If it’s an investment asset, then it’s not a charitable use asset, and they shouldn’t be counting it as such” on their IRS filings.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">In one similar instance involving another foundation, the IRS expressed hesitation about the organization’s plans, then backed off. In 2006, San Diego real estate magnate Matthew Strauss sought a $4 million write-off for the guesthouse that held part of his contemporary art collection. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23879865-strauss_1023_public#document/p215/a2365113">An IRS employee wrote</a> that it appeared Strauss and his wife “are using the assets of the Foundation (the guest house gallery) as a facility for housing and displaying a large portion of their personal art collection for their enjoyment and benefit as well as the enjoyment and benefit of invited guests.” The employee wanted to know when actual art would be donated, what kind of access the public would have to the gallery, and how the couple planned to inform people that they could visit, among other things.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">The couple’s lawyer assured the IRS representative that she’d gotten the wrong impression. The Strausses would host no personal events there and the public would have access to view the collection “upon request.” The couple anticipated donating “substantially all” of their $50 million collection to the foundation. They couldn’t say when, but the couple planned to make donations “in a fashion that minimizes income taxes.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">As 2006 turned into 2007 with no sign that the IRS would bless its museum tax deduction, the couple sought political help. In January, the head of the IRS’ tax-exempt division <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23879865-strauss_1023_public#document/p15/a2365110">received a letter</a> from the office of <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/F000062-dianne-feinstein">Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D.-Calif.)</a>, inquiring about the delay in approving the application from the couple, who’d given her more than $15,000 over the past few election cycles. That June, their application was approved. (“The senator was not advocating in support of the constituent’s application, but instead requested clarification on the case after nine months of an inability to resolve the case,” a spokesperson for Feinstein said, noting that her office frequently sends such letters on behalf of constituents).</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">As of 2021, 15 years after the Strausses’ lawyer told the IRS they would donate $50 million in art, the foundation holds $6 million worth. The rest remained in a private trust.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">To learn more about Strausses’ gallery, I tried to schedule a visit earlier this year. As with Carolands, I was able to get in, but it took some effort. The foundation’s website doesn’t list an address or hours of operation. A contact form available for visitors to inquire about tours wasn’t working when I tried it repeatedly. I ultimately had to pester employees of Strauss’ real estate company for a couple of weeks before someone responded and asked me to submit a biography for their boss to review. (My bio described me as a reporter with ProPublica, with the first coverage area listed as “tax policy.”)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">Soon after I sent in my biography, I received a call from Matthew Strauss himself. After a brief conversation, he declared me “worthy” of the first tour he said he’d given in three years and sent along directions to the museum.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">I didn’t see any signs outside the couple’s estate, nicknamed Rancho Del Arte, that indicated a museum could be found anywhere on the premises. From the outside, their guesthouse seemed relatively unassuming, its multimillion-dollar value betrayed only by the horse stables and privacy hedges of the nearby mansions I passed on the way in. A path wide enough for a golf cart wound its way through a grove of palm trees, past oversized sculptures and a private tennis court, to the Strausses’ own sprawling abode a hundred yards or so away.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">The inside was more remarkable. The Strausses remodeled the building in the early 2000s with custom fixtures to illuminate works from their collection of contemporary art. Sounds and music from dueling audiovisual works on the main floor flooded the space, while the click-clack of a never-ending ping pong game echoed up from a conceptual piece in the basement. These noisier forms shared space with paintings on canvas and metal and with textured mixed-media compositions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">Dressed in sweats and sporting a Bentley baseball cap, Strauss personally led my solo tour, meandering from one prized possession to the next. He exhibited an uncanny memory for how he obtained each piece, likening the acquisition process to the thrill of a hunt. (“Once you get the fox, it’s not as much fun.”) He spoke of one painting as “my poor man’s ‘Mona Lisa’” and another as “my victory piece.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">Halfway through my visit, we stopped to take in the view from the museum’s balcony. “At this point, you can see why I had to buy this property,” he told me, explaining that he’d bought the guesthouse from his neighbor in the late 1990s to keep anyone else from moving in. “Anybody here, they would have knocked it down, and you know, really ruined our privacy.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">As the tour continued from room to room, Strauss leaned into his persona as a friendly professor. He asked probing questions about each modern piece before delving into centuries of art history. “I really show [people] how to look at art, I don’t just tell them ‘This is So-and-So,’” he said, recalling the tours he used to give to college students.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">Before the pandemic, the foundation would conduct a dozen or two dozen tours each year, drawing a total of about 400 visitors to the gallery, according to the foundation’s website. But even as California’s other museums welcomed guests back in the spring of 2021, the foundation remained dormant.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">Strauss acknowledges the tax benefits of having the foundation and maintained that he had made efforts to make his art available to the public. “I feel like I have an obligation to show it, but it’s got to be under favorable conditions,” he said. He’d told me he’d like to get tours going again, but only when schools and universities stop requiring masks and start treating COVID-19 “like normal.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">Strauss said he gets requests from individuals to see the collection “all the time.” But, he added, “to show one or two, it’s not worthy. It’ll wear me out.” Letting people come on their own was out of the question (they might damage the art), as was having regular public hours (it’s a zoning issue, he said, and the neighbors would never go for it). Strauss declined to respond to a list of follow-up questions that I sent after the tour.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">A couple months from turning 90, Strauss was more focused on the big picture. Sooner or later, he said, he plans to give away most of the collection, which he estimates to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Most of his personal collection will go to the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, while the foundation’s assets will go to the University of California, San Diego under a deal that is in the process of being finalized.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">As we made our way through the gallery, Strauss paused before a reproduction of a Life magazine cover featuring the 1964 World’s Fair in New York. Did anything catch my eye about it, he asked. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.1">I stared for a moment.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.2">“Why don’t you knock on it,” he suggested. “Maybe that’ll help you.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.3">Strauss sensed my hesitation to touch the art — he wanted me to see it was made of metal — and tried to put me at ease.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.4">“You’re not supposed to,” he chuckled. “But this is my museum!”</p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Scientists at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus have discovered what they believe to be the central mechanism behind cognitive decline associated with normal aging.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“The mechanism involves the mis-regulation of a brain protein known as CaMKII which is crucial for memory and learning,” said the study’s co-senior author <a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/pharmacology/faculty/primary-faculty/ulli-bayer-phd" rel="noopener">Ulli Bayer,</a> PhD, professor of pharmacology at the <a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/" rel="noopener"><span>University of Colorado School of Medicine</span></a>. “This study directly suggests specific pharmacological treatment strategies.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scisignal.ade5892" rel="noopener">study was published</a> today in the journal `Science Signaling.’</p>
<p>Researchers using mouse models found that altering the CaMKII brain protein caused similar cognitive effects as those that happen through normal aging.</p>
<p>Bayer said that aging in mice and humans both decrease a process known as S-nitrosylation, the modification of a specific brain proteins including CaMKII.</p>
<p>“The current study now shows a decrease in this modification of CaMKII is sufficient to cause impairments in synaptic plasticity and in memory that are similar in aging,” Bayer said.</p>
<p>Normal aging reduces the amount of nitric oxide in the body. That in turn reduces nitrosylation which decreases memory and learning ability, the study said.</p>
<p>Bayer said the new research opens the way toward developing drugs and other therapeutic interventions that could normalize the nitrosylation of the protein. He said that holds out the possibility of treating or staving off normal cognitive decline for an unknown period of time.</p>
<p>He pointed out that this would only work in normal age-related cognitive decline, not the decline seen in Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.</p>
<p>“We know this protein can be targeted,” Bayer said. “And we think it could be done pharmacologically. That is the next logical step.”</p></span>

                <div><p>A biotech answer to the world’s epic sugar consumption could be in the works — if Amai Proteins gets its way. The synthetic biology company is gearing up to commercialize a microbially produced protein that on average is 3,000 times sweeter than sugar and, if widely adopted, could put a dent in the global metabolic disease and obesity epidemic. Amai is aiming for this protein to replace up to 70% of the added sugar without the health hazards and off-flavors of other synthetic and natural <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-05-2023-who-advises-not-to-use-non-sugar-sweeteners-for-weight-control-in-newly-released-guideline">sweeteners</a>.</p><div data-test="illustration" id="i1"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw703/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41587-023-01865-x/MediaObjects/41587_2023_1865_Figa_HTML.png?as=webp"><img alt="" aria-describedby="i1-desc" width="703" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw703/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41587-023-01865-x/MediaObjects/41587_2023_1865_Figa_HTML.png"></picture></div><p><span data-test="illustration-credit">
            Credit: Pazit Assulin, Amai Proteins</span></p></div></div><p>The origins of Amai’s product can be traced to the equatorial belt, where a natural protein called monellin was discovered in tropical berries. Although it is a protein, monellin also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.13239">docks to</a> the same sweet receptors as sugar, so has the same mouthfeel and taste profile. But there is a glitch. “This is a hyper-sweet protein, but it denatures at 45 degrees; just like boiling an egg, it loses functionality,” says Ilan Samish, Amai’s Founder and CEO.</p><p>Samish modified this plant protein with a method called agile integrative computational protein design (AI-CPD), a technique with which Samish worked and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-6637-0">published</a> as an academic researcher. Taking inspiration from extremophiles — organisms that withstand harsh pH, salt and temperature conditions — Samish applied AI-CPD to tweak monellin’s protein <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/328739a0">structure</a> and improve its characteristics — mainly stability, a critical feature for mass produced food products. “A protein is a sequence of pearls [amino acids]; we can change the sequence to build a new protein inspired by life in extreme conditions.” The result is a designer protein that is stable even at high temperatures and optimized for use as a food additive.</p><p>Next, the scientists at the Rehovot-based company biomanufacture the designer protein in yeast. “For us, fermentation is just like a brewery,” says Samish. Once the output is harvested, the yield is a pure protein, a white powder they call sweelin.</p><p>The company has tested sweelin in a range of foods, achieving a 70% reduction in the sugar content of ketchup and a 50% reduction in that of chocolate, for example, without changing palatability. “Supertasters can’t tell the difference,” says Samish. A huge advantage is that, unlike other sweeteners, sweelin is unlikely to interact with the gut microbiome. And because these sweet molecules are proteins, they are digested into amino acids without activating the insulin response.</p><p>Amai has so far raised $30 million and expects to close a series A investment soon. The company has ongoing collaborations with food manufacturers. The goal is to launch commercially in 2023 once they receive Generally Recognized as Safe status, first in the form of a self-affirmation and then from the US Food and Drug Administration. Beyond producing sweet food additives, the company anticipates optimizing other proteins for different uses. “Old-school agriculture cannot be sustained; we need to produce new tasty, healthy, cost-efficient and sustainable designer proteins for the mass food market. This is what we can do with synthetic biology.”</p>

<p>Article published by: Leah Rowe</p>
<p>Date of publication: 17 July 2023</p>
<p>People have been waiting for me to break the silence about this. I go on about it on IRC. This article is intended to address it once and for all, officially.</p>
<p>I waited so long, because until recently there really wasn’t anything tangible to talk about; why talk about vaporware? Why indeed.</p>
<div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction!</h2></div>
<p>This doesn’t need to be an overly long post, so it won’t be. There is a <em>fork</em> of Libreboot, named GNU Boot, which you can find here: <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnuboot/">https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnuboot/</a></p>
<p>Long story short, when I saw this, I decided that I would try to <em>help</em> the project. More on this next:</p>
<div><h2 id="non-genuine-boot-20230717-release">non-GeNUine Boot 20230717 release</h2></div>
<p>If you want to skip the lecture, just read these first and re-visit this page (the one you’re reading now) afterwards for more context:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>non-GeNUine Boot 20230717, unofficial release (produced by <em>me</em>): <a href="https://notgnuboot.vimuser.org/news/nongenuineboot20230717.html">https://notgnuboot.vimuser.org/news/nongenuineboot20230717.html</a> - based on the recent <a href="https://libreboot.org/news/libreboot20230625.html">Libreboot 20230625</a> release</strong>, but modified to comply with GNU Boot policy, as best as I could approximate. I <em>encourage them</em> to re-use this work. It’s roughly <em>8 months</em> ahead of their current work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or generally: <strong><a href="https://notgnuboot.vimuser.org/">https://notgnuboot.vimuser.org/</a> - non-GeNUine Boot website</strong></p>
<p>These links, above, are for an <em>unofficial</em> fork of Libreboot that <em>I</em> have done myself, proposed for re-use by the new GNU Boot project. I am <em>not</em> a member of the GNU Boot project, but I do want to see it succeed.</p>
<p>GNU Boot? What is that, you ask me? It is a fork of Libreboot by the GNU project, but it currently does not have a website and does not have any releases of its own. My intent is to <em>help them</em>, and they are free - encouraged - to re-use my work, linked above.</p>
<div><h2 id="gnu-forked-libreboot">GNU forked Libreboot?</h2></div>
<div><h2 id="why">Why?</h2></div>
<p>They forked Libreboot, due to disagreement with Libreboot’s <a href="https://libreboot.org/news/policy.html">Binary Blob Reduction Policy</a>. This is a pragmatic policy, enacted in November 2022, to increase the number of coreboot users by increasing the amount of hardware supported in Libreboot. Libreboot’s <a href="https://libreboot.org/freedom-status.html">Freedom Status</a> page describes in great detail, how that policy is implemented - the last few Libreboot releases have <em>vastly</em> expanded the list of hardware supported, which you can read <a href="https://libreboot.org/docs/hardware/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I wish GNU Boot all the best success. Truly. Although I think their project is entirely misguided (for reasons explained by modern Libreboot policy), I do think there is value in it. It provides continuity for those who wish to use something resembling the old Libreboot project; some context:</p>
<div><h2 id="osboot">osboot</h2></div>
<p>Previously, another project started by me named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220714144846/https://osboot.org/">osboot</a> existed - osboot, created in December 2020, ran for just under two years as a separate project, and it very much resembled what Libreboot is today.</p>
<p>osboot was a fork of Libreboot, that I created <em>myself</em>, and maintained in parallel to Libreboot. The old osboot Git repositories are <em>still available</em> here, archived for historical purposes: <a href="https://notabug.org/osboot">https://notabug.org/osboot</a></p>
<div><h2 id="osbootlibreboot-merge">osboot/libreboot merge</h2></div>
<p>In November 2022, I <em>shut down</em> osboot’s website and redirected it to the Libreboot website, merging all of its documentation and additional code into Libreboot. Libreboot <em>adopted</em> OSBoot policy, verbatim. The <a href="https://libreboot.org/news/policy.html">Binary Blob Reduction Policy</a> <em>is</em> that policy - the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221107235850/https://libreboot.org/news/policy.html">old Libreboot policy</a> was declared obsolete, and abandoned - the main problem with it, and the problem with GNU Boot today which is based on it, is that it limited the amount of hardware that Libreboot could support.</p>
<p>OSBoot was always the superior project, and Libreboot was practically dead, so I saw nothing to lose and just did it. I merged them together.</p>
<div><h2 id="so-why-talk-about-gnu-boot">So why talk about GNU Boot?</h2></div>
<p>Ordinarily, I would ignore other projects; it’s not that I’m bothered by them, it’s just that I have Libreboot, which pleases me, and therefore I have no need to worry about the others. They can sort themselves out. I work collaboratively with a few other coreboot distros; for example, I sometimes provide advice or ideas to the <a href="https://osresearch.net/">Heads</a> project (a very interesting project, superior to Libreboot in many ways). I recently helped them by offering to host tarballs for them, that they use in their build system.</p>
<p>But that’s just the problem: when GNU Boot first launched, as a failed <em>hostile fork</em> of Libreboot <em>under the same name</em>, I observed: their code repository was based on Libreboot from late 2022, and their website based on Libreboot in late 2021. Their same-named Libreboot site was announced during LibrePlanet 2023, by this video: <a href="https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/taking-control-over-the-means-of-production-free-software-boot/">https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/taking-control-over-the-means-of-production-free-software-boot/</a> - their speaker is Denis Carikli, an early contributor to Libreboot, who you can read about here: <a href="https://libreplanet.org/2023/speakers/#6197">https://libreplanet.org/2023/speakers/#6197</a>. Denis is one of the founders of that project.</p>
<p>Well, now they are calling themselves <em>GNU Boot</em>, and it is indeed GNU, but it still has the same problem as of <em>today</em>: still based on very old Libreboot, and they don’t <em>even</em> have a website. According to Savannah, GNU Boot was created on 11 June 2023. Yet no real development, in over a month since then.</p>
<p>I have this itch in the back of my mind, that says: if you’re going to do something, you should <em>do it</em>. When someone expresses disagreement with what I say, I can respect it if it’s more than just words, which is all what they had given at the time of this article.</p>
<p>I value <em>technical excellence</em>.</p>
<div><h2 id="so-why-talk-about-it">So <em>why talk about it??</em></h2></div>
<p>Simple: I’ve decided that I want to <strong>help them</strong>. Refer to the links above, in the early section of this article. I decided recently that I’d simply make a release <em>for them</em>, exactly to their specifications (GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines), talking favourably about FSF/GNU, and so on. I’m in a position to <em>do it</em> (thus scratching the itch), so why not?</p>
<p><strong>I did this release for them: <a href="https://notgnuboot.vimuser.org/news/nongenuineboot20230717.html">https://notgnuboot.vimuser.org/news/nongenuineboot20230717.html</a></strong> - it’s designated <em>non-GeNUine Boot 20230717</em>, and I encourage them to re-use this in their project, to get off the ground. This completely leapfrogs their current development; it’s months ahead. <em>Months</em>. <strong>It’s 8 months ahead</strong>, since their current revision is based upon Libreboot from around ~October 2022.</p>
<p>The most remarkable thing of all is this: in December 2022 is when I first learned of their supposed effort. They tried to poach several Libreboot developers behind my back, but none of them were interested it seems, and one of them leaked the existence of their effort to me. I knew <em>three months</em> before they announced that they were going to announce something, and I reliably predicted it’d be at LibrePlanet.</p>
<p>The most absurd thing of that is: why did they not contact <em>me</em>?</p>
<p>The GNU people should have simply contacted me from the start. I <em>would</em> have helped them. I did Libreboot releases under their policies for <em>years</em>, and I know what I’m doing. Ideology aside, I enjoy fun technical challenges; I have a wide depth of knowledge and expertise. <em>I offer it now</em>, as I have today, and will continue to do so. I offer my <em>support</em>, in service to it, even if I would personally never use nor recommend their project. One of the purposes of today’s article is simply to tell people they exist, because I hope maybe they’ll get more devs. They use the same build system as Libreboot, so Libreboot could even merge a lot of any actual code/ideas that they produce (and they can merge our work - <em>and I want them to do that</em>).</p>
<p>There were/are more things to talk about, but I’m not really interested in writing more. Free as in freedom? Libreboot is a free software project, yet GNU propaganda says otherwise.</p>
<p>GNU Boot is <a href="https://libreboot.org/policy.html#problems-with-fsdg">inferior</a> to Libreboot in every way, just as Libreboot was inferior to OSBoot before the Libreboot/OSBoot merge; since modern (post-merge) Libreboot still provides the same blob-free configurations on mainboards when that is possible, GNU Boot is also a <em>pointless</em> project, just as Libreboot was before I merged osboot with it, but I digress.</p>
<p>What more is there to say?</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>
<div><h2 id="update-21-july-2023">UPDATE (21 July 2023)</h2></div>
<p>The non-GeNUine Boot website, and the non-GeNUine release itself, was originally <em>named</em> GNU Boot, but clearly marked as <em>unofficial</em>, with the hope that the GNU project would adapt and re-use it for their project. I did this, specifically to help them get up to date. They currently use Libreboot from about 8 months ago (late 2022), and that revision used <em>coreboot</em> releases from ~mid 2021.</p>
<p>Modern Libreboot uses coreboot from early 2023, and contains many bug fixes in its build system, owing to an extensive <a href="https://libreboot.org/news/audit.html">build system audit</a>; GNU Boot still contains all of the bugs that existed, prior to the audit. Bugs such as: errors literally not being handled, in many critical areas of the build system, due to improper use of subshells within shell scripts (Libreboot’s build system is implemented with shell scripts), improper handling of git credentials in the coreboot build system, fam15h boards no longer compiling correct on modern Linux distros… the list goes on. All fixed, in newer Libreboot, including the recent release.</p>
<div><h2 id="gnu-boot-cease-and-desist-email">GNU Boot cease and desist email</h2></div>
<p>The GNU Boot people actually sent me a cease and desist email, citing trademark infringement. Amazing.</p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://notgnuboot.vimuser.org/">nonGeNUine Boot</a> site having clearly stating that it’s unofficial, and <em>not</em> the GNU Boot project. I literally made it to help them. You know, to help them use newer Libreboot because they use old Libreboot and even older coreboot.</p>
<p>Anyway, I complied with their polite request and have renamed the project to non-GeNUine Boot. The release archive was re-compiled, under this new brand name and the website was re-written accordingly.</p>
<p>Personally, I like the new name better.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the cease and desist request that I received, from <em>Adrien ‘neox’ Bourmault</em> who is a founding member of the GNU Boot project:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://av.vimuser.org/email.png"></p>
<p>This, after they themselves tried to steal the name <em>Libreboot</em> for their fork, when they first announced themselves on 19 March 2023 at LibrePlanet, only renaming to <em>GNU Boot</em> months later (on 11 June 2023). Utter hypocrisy, and a great irony to boot.</p>
<p>I may very well send patches. <em>If I want to</em>.</p>

        <p data-msgid="__MSG_websiteIntro__">Snowflake is a system that <strong>allows people from all over the world to access censored websites and applications</strong>. Similar to how VPNs assist users in getting around Internet censorship, Snowflake helps you avoid being noticed by Internet censors by making your Internet activity appear as though you're using the Internet for a regular video or voice call.</p>

        <p data-msgid="__MSG_websiteIntro2__">There are numerous tools available, such as Snowflake, that "transform" Internet activity, each using a different technique. Some redirect Internet traffic to appear to be coming from popular cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Others scramble Internet traffic in order to make it appear completely random.</p>
                        
        <p data-msgid="__MSG_websiteIntro3__">It therefore becomes costly for censors to consider blocking such circumvention tools since it would require blocking large parts of the Internet in order to achieve the initial targeted goal.</p>

            <p data-msgid="__MSG_censoredUsers__">Unlike VPNs, you do not need to install a separate application to connect to a Snowflake proxy and bypass censorship. It is usually a circumvention feature embedded within existing apps. Currently Snowflake is available inside <a href="https://torproject.org/download">Tor Browser</a> on Desktop and Android, <a href="https://onionbrowser.com/">Onion Browser</a> on iOS, and <a href="https://orbot.app/">Orbot</a> on Android and iOS. If you have downloaded and installed any of these apps, and they are censored in your country, you can bypass the censorship by activating Snowflake through the apps' settings page.</p>

In other words, a user gets matched with a random Snowflake volunteer proxy, which is run by a volunteer like you! So, if you want to help people bypass censorship, consider installing and running a Snowflake proxy. The only prerequisite is that the Internet in your country is <strong>not</strong> heavily censored already.</p>

            <p data-msgid="__MSG_volunteer__">You can join thousands of volunteers from around the world who have a Snowflake proxy installed and running. There is no need to worry about which websites people are accessing through your Snowflake proxy. Their visible browsing IP address will match their Tor exit node, not yours.</p>

<p>The latest part of an Apple device to demand a repair by its maker appears to be the screens on newer iPads. Reports from repair shops and customers suggest that Apple Pencils no longer work properly on non-genuine Apple screens, as they draw squiggly lines on a diagonal instead of straight.</p>
<p>Ricky Panesar, CEO of UK repair firm iCorrect, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2023/07/27/apple-punishing-ipad-pro-buyers-with-new-pencil-software-lockdown/?sh=71a333304b5f">told Forbes</a> that screens replaced on newer iPad Pros (fifth and sixth-generation 12.9-inch and third and fourth-generation 11-inch models) do not deliver straight lines when an <a href="https://amzn.to/3QhfZdL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Pencil</a> is used to draw at an angle. "They have a memory chip that sits on the screen that's programmed to only allow the Pencil functionality to work if the screen is connected to the original logic board," Panesar told Forbes.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/13q5dvo/jittery_diagonal_lines_on_ipad_mini_using_apple/">Reddit post from May 23</a> from a user reporting "jittery" diagonal lines from an Apple <a href="https://amzn.to/3QhfZdL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pencil</a> on a newly replaced iPad mini screen suggests the issue may affect more than just the Pro line of iPads.</p>

<p>Apple continues to suggest, in varying degrees of forcefulness, that it be the only company to repair its customers' devices. At the least, the company seems to believe that only Apple Genuine Replacement Parts should be used by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/apple-gives-third-party-repair-shops-more-access-to-authorized-parts/">licensed technicians</a> or—with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/macbook-self-repair-program-highlights-apples-flawed-repairability-progress/">a suitcase full of tools</a>—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/apple-will-soon-send-parts-and-tools-to-users-who-want-to-repair-their-phones/">individuals</a>. Every other kind of repair is subject to complications by Apple's tying of parts to individual devices, known as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/france-is-fighting-to-save-your-iphone-from-an-early-death">serialization</a>. Batteries, screens, and Touch ID sensors are all subject to display warnings to users or lose some functionality when transplanted outside of Apple's repair network.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>This stance, and the company's size and influence, makes Apple a primary target of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/the-same-phone-for-25-years-ifixit-on-right-to-repairs-remaining-obstacles-hope/">right-to-repair campaigns</a>, as well as legislation in the EU seeking to boost their devices' interoperability, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/the-clock-is-rapidly-ticking-on-apples-lightning-charger/">USB-C mandates</a>.</p>
<p>This latest complaint by the repair community about screen pairing echoes an issue that arose with the then-new iPhone 13 line in 2021. Repair techs found that replacing the screen, even with a genuine Apple screen with the Face ID module laboriously transferred over (but not paired by Apple's proprietary software), would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/apple-will-no-longer-break-face-id-on-repaired-iphone-13s/">disable Face ID on the device</a>. Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772433/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacements-face-id-software-update">later told The Verge</a> that it would "release a software update" to fix the issue without detailing whether it was a bug or an intentional design choice.</p>
<p>Ars contacted Apple for comment and will update this article if we receive a response.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> This photo-illustration of the EXE:5000, ASML’s high-numerical-aperture extreme-ultraviolet-lithography machine, shows its massive scale. </p><div data-elid="2662495820" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/high-na-euv" data-authors="Jan van Schoot" data-headline="This Machine Could Keep Moore’s Law on Track" data-page-title="This Machine Could Keep Moore’s Law on Track - IEEE Spectrum"><p><strong>Over the last half-century</strong>, we’ve come to think of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/moore-s-law?__rblms_page_revalidate=1" target="_self">Moore’s Law</a>—the roughly biennial doubling of the number of transistors in a given area of silicon, the gains that drive computing forward—as something that just happens, as though it were a natural, inevitable process, akin to evolution or aging. The reality, of course, is much different. Keeping pace with Moore’s Law requires almost unimaginable expenditures of time, energy, and human ingenuity—thousands of people on multiple continents and endless acres of some of the most complex machinery on the planet.
</p><p>
	Perhaps the most essential of these machines performs 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/euv?__rblms_page_revalidate=1" target="_self">extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) photolithography</a>. EUV lithography, the product of decades of R&amp;D, is now the driving technology behind the past two generations of cutting-edge chips, used in every top-end smartphone, tablet, laptop, and server in the last three years. Yet Moore’s Law must march on, and chipmakers continue to advance their road maps, meaning they’ll need to shrink device geometries even further.
</p><p>
	So at 
	<a href="https://www.asml.com/en" target="_blank">ASML</a>, my colleagues and I are developing the next generation of lithography. Called high-numerical-aperture EUV lithography, it involves a major overhaul of the system’s internal optics. High-NA EUV should be ready for commercial use in 2025, and chipmakers are depending on its capabilities to keep their promised advances through the end of this decade
</p><h2>The 3 factors of photolithography
</h2><p>
	Moore’s Law relies on improving the resolution of photolithography so chipmakers can lay down finer and finer circuits. Over the last 35 years, engineers have achieved a resolution reduction of two orders of magnitude by working on a combination of three factors: the wavelength of the light; k
	<sub>1</sub>, a coefficient that encapsulates process-related factors; and numerical aperture (NA), a measure of the range of angles over which the system can emit light.
</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="An equation with four variablesCAPTION: The critical dimension\u2014the resolution of a photolithography system\u2014is equal to the wavelength of light used divided by the numerical aperture and multiplied by a quality, k1, related to process improvements. " data-rm-shortcode-id="fdb861cd8f18df59eb46c689063ed42d" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-equation-with-four-variablescaption-the-critical-dimension-u2014the-resolution-of-a-photolithography-system-u2014is-equal-to.png?id=34683428&amp;width=980" height="1667" id="65497" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-equation-with-four-variablescaption-the-critical-dimension-u2014the-resolution-of-a-photolithography-system-u2014is-equal-to.png?id=34683428&amp;width=980" width="2500"><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Source: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</a></small></p><p>
	The critical dimension—that is, the smallest possible feature size you can print with a certain photolithography-exposure tool—is proportional to the wavelength of light divided by the numerical aperture of the optics. So you can achieve smaller critical dimensions by using either shorter light wavelengths or larger numerical apertures or a combination of the two. The k
	<sub>1</sub> value can be pushed as close as possible to its physical lower limit of 0.25 by improving manufacturing-process control, for example.
</p><p>
	In general, the most economical ways to boost resolution are by increasing the numerical aperture and by improving tool and process control to allow for a smaller k
	<sub>1</sub>. Only after chipmakers run out of options to further improve NA and k<sub>1</sub> do they resort to reducing the wavelength of the light source.
</p><p>
	Nevertheless, the industry has had to make that wavelength change a number of times. The historical progression of wavelengths went from 365 nanometers, generated using a mercury lamp, to 248 nm, via a krypton-fluoride laser, in the late 1990s, and then to 193 nm, from an argon-fluoride laser, at the beginning of this century. For each generation of wavelength, the numerical aperture of lithography systems was progressively increased before industry jumped to a shorter wavelength.
</p><p>
	For example, as the use of 193 nm was coming to an end, a novel approach to increasing NA was introduced: 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-makings-wet-new-world" target="_self">immersion lithography</a>. By placing water between the bottom of the lens and the wafer, the NA could be significantly enlarged from 0.93 to 1.35. From its introduction around 2006, 193-nm immersion lithography was the industry workhorse for leading-edge lithography

That’s due in part to using smaller and smaller wavelengths of light, but it has also required greater numerical aperture and improved processing techniques.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Source: ASML</small></p><h2>The dawn of EUV<br></h2><p>
	But as the need to print features smaller than 30 nm increased, and because the NA of 193-nm lithography had been maxed out, keeping up with Moore’s Law grew more and more complex. To create features smaller than 30 nm requires either using multiple patterns to produce a single layer of chip features—a technologically and economically burdensome technique—or another change of wavelength. It took more than 20 years and an 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/euv-lithography-finally-ready-for-chip-manufacturing" target="_self">unparalleled development effort</a> to bring the next new wavelength online: 13.5-nm EUV.
</p><p>
	EUV necessitates an entirely new way to generate light. It’s a remarkably complex process that involves hitting molten tin droplets in midflight with a powerful CO<sub>2</sub> laser. The laser vaporizes the tin into a plasma, emitting a spectrum of photonic energy. From this spectrum, the EUV optics harvest the required 13.5-nm wavelength and direct it through a series of mirrors before it is reflected off a patterned mask to project that pattern onto the wafer. And all of this must be done in an ultraclean vacuum, because the 13.5-nm wavelength is absorbed by air. (In previous generations of photolithography, light was directed through the mask to project a pattern onto the wafer. But EUV is so readily absorbed that the mask and other optics must be reflective instead.)
</p><p><img alt="A cutaway of a rectangular machine. Purple beams bounce off objects within the machine." data-rm-shortcode-id="2cfd20962a6e1b5082da079d8a9b85ae" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-cutaway-of-a-rectangular-machine-purple-beams-bounce-off-objects-within-the-machine.jpg?id=34683370&amp;width=980" height="1400" id="41478" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-cutaway-of-a-rectangular-machine-purple-beams-bounce-off-objects-within-the-machine.jpg?id=34683370&amp;width=980" width="2500"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">In a vacuum chamber, EUV light [purple] reflects off multiple mirrors before bouncing off the photomask [top center]. From there the light continues its journey until it is projected onto the wafer [bottom center], carrying the photomask’s pattern. The illustration shows today’s commercial system with a 0.33 numerical aperture. The optics in future systems, with an NA of 0.55, will be different.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Source: ASML</small></p><p>
	The switch to EUV from 193-nanometer light did part of the job of decreasing the critical dimension. A process called “design for manufacturing,” which involves setting the design rules of circuit blocks to take advantage of photolithography’s limits, has done a lot to reduce k
	<sub>1</sub>. Now it’s time to boost numerical aperture again, from today’s 0.33 to 0.55.<br></p><h2>Making high-NA EUV work </h2><p>
	Increasing the NA from today’s 0.33 to the target value of 0.55 inevitably entails a cascade of other adjustments. Projection systems like EUV lithography have an NA at the wafer and also at the mask. When you increase the NA at the wafer, it also increases the NA at the mask. Consequently, at the mask, the incoming and outgoing cones of light become larger and must be angled away from each other to avoid overlapping. Overlapping cones of light produce an asymmetric diffraction pattern, resulting in unpleasant imaging effects.
</p><p>
	But there’s a limit to this angle. Because the reflective masks needed for EUV lithography are actually made of multiple layers of material, you can’t ensure getting a proper reflection above a certain reflective angle. EUV masks have a maximum reflective angle of 11 degrees. There are other challenges as well, but reflective angle is the biggest.

So high-NA EUV uses anamorphic optics, which allow the angle to increase in only one direction [right]. The field that can be imaged this way is half the size, so the pattern on the mask must be distorted in one direction, but that’s good enough to maintain throughput through the machine.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Source: ASML</small></p><p>
	The only way to overcome this challenge is to increase a quality called demagnification. Demagnification is exactly what it sounds like—taking the reflected pattern from the mask and shrinking it. To compensate for the reflective-angle problem, my colleagues and I had to double the demagnification to 8x. As a consequence, the part of the mask imaged will be much smaller on the wafer. This smaller image field means it will take longer to produce the complete chip pattern. Indeed, this requirement would reduce the throughput of our high-NA scanner to under 100 wafers per hour—a productivity level that would make chip manufacturing uneconomical.
	<br></p><p>
	Thankfully, we found that it is necessary to increase the demagnification in only one direction—the one in which the largest reflective angles occur. The demagnification in the other direction can remain unchanged. This results in an acceptable field size on the wafer—about half the size used in today’s EUV systems, or 26 by 16.5 millimeters instead of 26 by 33 mm. This kind of direction-dependent, or anamorphic, demagnification forms the basis of our high-NA system. The optics manufacturer Carl Zeiss has made a herculean effort to design and manufacture an anamorphic lens with the specifications required for our new machine.
</p><p>
	To ensure the same productivity levels with the half-size field, we had to redevelop the system’s reticle and wafer stages—the platforms that hold the mask and wafer, respectively—and move them in sync with each other as the scanning process takes place. The redesign resulted in nanometer-precision stages with acceleration improved by a factor of four.
</p><h2>High-NA EUV in production in 2025 </h2><p>
	The first high-NA EUV system, the ASML EXE:5000, will be installed in a new lab that we’re opening jointly with the Belgium-based nanoelectronics research facility Imec, in early 2024. This lab will allow customers, mask makers, photoresist suppliers, and others to develop the infrastructure needed to make high-NA EUV a reality.
</p><p>
	And it is essential that we do make it a reality, because high-NA EUV is a critical component in keeping Moore’s Law alive. Getting to 0.55 NA won’t be the final step, though. From there, ASML, Zeiss, and the entire semiconductor ecosystem will be stretching even further toward technologies that are better, faster, and innovative in ways we can hardly imagine yet.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>2022-06-04</p></header><section><p>A “call to action,” also known as <em>CTA</em>, is an interface design technique based on “engaging” text labels on widgets to direct users towards a previously defined goal within an application, website, device, etc. (That goal is usually defined by the designers of the system.) Every computer user is probably familiar with buttons labeled in an ambiguous voice, oscillating in between presenting dialog options from the perspective of the user (“I agree to terms and conditions”—the user is talking) and the system offering and suggesting options (“Follow us”—the system is talking).</p><p>In most cases buttons labeled in this way can be considered pretty classic interface design: they’re presenting actions a user can activate to change the state of the system according to the user’s mental model. For instance, after pushing “I agree to terms and conditions” the system gained information from the user and will present different options to them; after pushing “Follow us” the system is reconfigured to frequently communicate with the user.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>A few years ago, a new style of button labeling emerged that appears only sightly different, but turns around the whole idea of what a button is. Such buttons are labeled “Get started,” “Explore,” “Launch experience,” etc. and are links to other parts of a system. Pushing them doesn’t change anything in the system’s state, as could be expected from a classic button. Instead, they’re supposed to reconfigure the user’s state. Users have to accept the spelled out mantra and change their attitude before accessing the next piece of information. The work required for this reconfiguration is entirely on the side of the user, the computer doesn’t act as a tool to complete this mini task, the user has to do it on their own.</p><p>Below are a few examples screenshotted from random mainstream websites.</p><figure><a href="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/start-now.png"><img src="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/start-now_hu23385a22429f5f26f328934b4a8cf00e_8991_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png" width="150" height="56" srcset="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/start-now_hu23385a22429f5f26f328934b4a8cf00e_8991_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png 1x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/start-now.png 2x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/start-now_hu23385a22429f5f26f328934b4a8cf00e_8991_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png"></a></figure><figure><a href="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/start-doing.png"><img src="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/start-doing_hud7cd3b2798636930afbb98cee5514fae_9448_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png" width="150" height="49" srcset="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/start-doing_hud7cd3b2798636930afbb98cee5514fae_9448_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png 1x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/start-doing.png 2x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/start-doing_hud7cd3b2798636930afbb98cee5514fae_9448_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png"></a></figure><figure><a href="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/create.png"><img src="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/create_huffaae38e25742b8c1b10d4faeb33f0cd_6141_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png" width="150" height="76" srcset="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/create_huffaae38e25742b8c1b10d4faeb33f0cd_6141_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png 1x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/create.png 2x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/create_huffaae38e25742b8c1b10d4faeb33f0cd_6141_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png"></a></figure><p>The “Start now” button prompts users to change plans they might have had and “start” right away, instead of maybe next week after completing another project, or on returning from vacation. The “Start doing” button avoids being specific about what should be done and is thereby referring to doing as a value in itself. The user should transform themselves into a “doer,” rather than being considerate, evaluating options, or—lazy, a looser, a mere consumer. The “Create” button welcomes confident “creators.” Before proceeding, users should identify with this new aristocratic class.</p><figure><a href="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/explore.png"><img src="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/explore_hub8b1747f8f1d6e7463ef62ef44816422_43449_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png" width="150" height="72" srcset="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/explore_hub8b1747f8f1d6e7463ef62ef44816422_43449_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png 1x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/explore.png 2x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/explore_hub8b1747f8f1d6e7463ef62ef44816422_43449_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png"></a></figure><figure><a href="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/explore-more.png"><img src="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/explore-more_huf7773008956bb73b1a5fa18dd5f290da_8123_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png" width="150" height="56" srcset="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/explore-more_huf7773008956bb73b1a5fa18dd5f290da_8123_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png 1x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/explore-more.png 2x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/explore-more_huf7773008956bb73b1a5fa18dd5f290da_8123_150x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png"></a></figure><figure><a href="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/discover-more.png"><img src="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/discover-more_hu14e96708ce7d2aea6c1145287a8da9bd_11969_200x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png" width="200" height="65" srcset="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/discover-more_hu14e96708ce7d2aea6c1145287a8da9bd_11969_200x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png 1x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/discover-more.png 2x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/discover-more_hu14e96708ce7d2aea6c1145287a8da9bd_11969_200x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png"></a></figure><p>“Explore” buttons usually link to lists of offerings that should ideally be consumed with the user being in an exploratory mood. The “Explore more” button requires that the user already has done some exploring and wants to continue. The “Discover more” button requires that the user already has made at least one discovery and expects to find more.

A Call To Action (<em>CTA</em>) uses verbs telling the users what they should do, and why. It can be represented by both links and buttons. Button Pushes You (<em>BPY</em>) takes the shape of a button in most cases; the label is short, avoids nouns, and tells the user how to assess the information they’re going to encounter when following the button-shaped link.</p><p>Again, BPY at first glance might look like the classic hypertext technique, in which the author of a link creates context with the link label. A classic example would be a link to a policitians site labeled “biggest idiot ever.” However this is clearly the author becoming visible and stating their own opinion. BPY is all about stating the user’s opinion.</p><p>The net art piece <em>Kill That Cat</em> by Mouchette (Martine Nedame), 1999, clearly lays out how users that push a button are reconfiguring themselves rather than the system. On the entrance page of the work, a picture of a cat and a button labeled “KILL THAT CAT” quickly move around in the browser window. When the user manages to catch the button with their mouse cursor and push it, they are presented with a guestbook interface in which they have to justify their action of killing the cat. Of course no cat is killed, the button just acts as a link to the guestbook.</p><figure><a href="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/cat-1.png"><img src="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/cat-1_hu0803680cf1734e811de531c14a23e92b_502697_600x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/cat-1_hu0803680cf1734e811de531c14a23e92b_502697_600x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png 1x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/cat-1.png 2x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/cat-1_hu0803680cf1734e811de531c14a23e92b_502697_600x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png"></a></figure><figure><a href="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/cat-2.png"><img src="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/cat-2_hu31217225023f1ca8d821baaa57c11b4f_551938_600x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/cat-2_hu31217225023f1ca8d821baaa57c11b4f_551938_600x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png 1x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/cat-2.png 2x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/cat-2_hu31217225023f1ca8d821baaa57c11b4f_551938_600x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png"></a><figcaption><p>Both screenshots: Mouchette, <em>Kill That Cat</em>, 1999.

As a foundational element of graphical user interfaces, a button is an surface on a display that through its visual design signals that it can be activated with a pointing device like a mouse, pen, or via touch. A button also serves a communicative role. Activating it is supposed to change the state of an application. For instance, buttons confirm a purchase, mute or enable sound, change the size of a virtual pencil’s tip, and so forth. Human interface guidelines of dominant players in the field show little variation in between them.</p><p>Apple defines buttons as elements that immediately change something in an application:</p><blockquote><p>A push button appears within a view and initiates an instantaneous app-specific action, such as printing a document or deleting a file.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Microsoft’s version reads quite the same, and additionally provides designers with suggestions when hyperlinks would be more appropriate to use than buttons. This might be the best and most precise guideline on buttons in this list.</p><blockquote><p>A button gives the user a way to trigger an immediate action. Some buttons are specialized for particular tasks, such as navigation, repeated actions, or presenting menus.<br>[…]<br>Don’t use a Button control when the action is to navigate to another page; instead, use a HyperlinkButton control.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Google’s “classic” Material Design version 2 component documentation even sounds a bit like an advertisement for what buttons can do:</p><blockquote><p>Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>The new and updated guide for Material Design 3, which will probably soon replace previous versions, already points towards a shift for the role of buttons. The description skips foundational statements and jumps right into declaring that</p><blockquote><p>Material Design includes nine types of buttons.</p></blockquote><p>Then it goes to great lengths sorting them by “level of emphasis”:</p><blockquote><p>A button’s level of emphasis helps determine its appearance, typography, and placement.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>The importance of a button, as decided by the designer of a system using Material Design, is the only determining factor for its visual appearance. The supposedly least important buttons, called “Text Buttons,” don’t have an outline or elevated appearance; they’re just text in different color, in other words, they look exactly like hyperlinks. The idea is that the more visual features of a classic button a Material Design button exposes—outline, distinct background color, elevated apprarance—the more likely a user is to “tap.”</p><figure><a href="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/material-3-buttons.png"><img src="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/material-3-buttons_hue7aea8edbeb7cb97211b437793622df8_45145_600x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png" width="600" height="301" srcset="https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/material-3-buttons_hue7aea8edbeb7cb97211b437793622df8_45145_600x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png 1x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/material-3-buttons.png 2x, https://despens.systems/2022/06/button-pushes-you/material-3-buttons_hue7aea8edbeb7cb97211b437793622df8_45145_600x0_resize_mitchellnetravali_3.png"></a><figcaption><p>Material Design 3 buttons sorted from highest emphasis (1) to lowest emphasis (5). Cropped image copied 2022-06-04 from <a href="https://m3.material.io/components/all-buttons">All buttons</a> from Google’s Material Design 3 documentation.</p></figcaption></figure><p>This means that Material Design 3 acknowledges that an element that looks like a button communicates something different than an element that looks like a hyperlink. If nothing else, the level of activity and manipulation is understood to be higher when more button signifiers are present. Yet Google’s guidelines choose to not use this for communicating choices and functions or non-functions to users. Instead, they’re nudging users to follow links by pushing buttons, so they reconfigure themselves to think that they changed something.</p><p>As Material Design 3 has formalized BPY, it has to be expected that these types of buttons will become an accepted standard for all kinds of user interfaces, and designers will strive to name and strcuture products and activities accordingly. BPY represents a shift to turning user interfaces into a decision theatre that, by redefining long established elements, tricks users into performing work for the system they’re using.</p><p>(This article is based on <a href="https://post.lurk.org/@despens/108296474653352073">a thread on post.lurk.org</a>.)</p></section></article></div>]]></description>

        <p>Tobacco companies knew that cigarette smoke contained radioactive alpha particles for more than four decades and developed "deep and intimate" knowledge of these particles' cancer-causing potential, but they deliberately kept their findings from the public, according to a new study by UCLA researchers.</p>  <p>The analysis of dozens of previously unexamined internal tobacco industry documents, made available in 1998 as the result of a legal settlement, reveals that the industry was aware of cigarette radioactivity some five years earlier than previously thought and that tobacco companies, concerned about the potential lung cancer risk, began in-depth investigations into the possible effects of radioactivity on smokers as early as the 1960s.</p>  <p>"The documents show that the industry was well aware of the presence of a radioactive substance in tobacco as early as 1959," the authors write. "Furthermore, the industry was not only cognizant of the potential 'cancerous growth' in the lungs of regular smokers, but also did quantitative radiobiological calculations to estimate the long-term lung radiation absorption dose of ionizing alpha particles emitted from cigarette smoke."</p>  <p>The study, published&nbsp;online&nbsp;Sept. 27&nbsp;in Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research, the peer-reviewed journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, adds to a growing body of research detailing the industry's knowledge of cigarette smoke radioactivity and its efforts to suppress that information.</p>  <p>"They knew that the cigarette smoke was radioactive way back then and that it could potentially result in cancer, and they deliberately kept that information under wraps," said the study's first author, Hrayr S. Karagueuzian, an adjunct professor of cardiology who conducts research at UCLA's Cardiovascular Research Laboratory, part of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. "Specifically, we show here that the industry used misleading statements to obfuscate the hazard of ionizing alpha particles to the lungs of smokers and, more importantly, banned any and all publication on tobacco smoke radioactivity."</p>  <p>The radioactive substance — which the UCLA study shows was first brought to the attention of the tobacco industry in 1959 — was identified in 1964 as the isotope polonium-210, which emits carcinogenic alpha radiation. Polonium-210 can be found in all commercially available domestic and foreign cigarette brands, Karagueuzian said, and is absorbed by tobacco leaves through naturally occurring radon gas in the atmosphere and through high-phosphate chemical fertilizers used by tobacco growers. The substance is eventually inhaled by smokers into the lungs.</p>  <p>The study outlines the industry's growing concerns about the cancer risk posed by polonium-210 inhalation and the research that industry scientists conducted over the decades to assess the radioactive isotope's potential effect on smokers — including one study that quantitatively measured the potential lung burden from radiation exposure in a two-pack-a-day smoker over a two-decade period.</p>  <p>Karagueuzian and his colleagues made independent calculations using industry and academic data and arrived at results that very closely mirrored those of that industry study, which was conducted nearly a quarter-century ago. They then compared those results to rates used by the Environmental Protection Agency to estimate lung cancer risk among individuals exposed to similar amounts of alpha particle–emitting radon gas in their homes.</p>  <p>"The gathered data from the documents on the relevant radiobiological parameters of the alpha particles — such as dose, distribution and retention time — permitted us to duplicate the industry's secretly estimated radiation absorbed dose by regular smokers over a 20- or 25-year period, which equaled 40 to 50 rads," he said. "These levels of rads, according to the EPA's estimate of lung cancer risk in residents exposed to radon gas, equal 120 to 138 deaths per 1,000 regular smokers over a 25-year period."</p>  <p>Despite the potential risk of lung cancer, tobacco companies declined to adopt a technique discovered in 1959, and another discovered&nbsp;1980, that could have helped eliminate polonium-210 from tobacco, the researchers said. The technique, known as an acid-wash, was found to be highly effective in removing the radioisotope from tobacco plants, where it forms a water-insoluble complex with the sticky, hair-like structures called trichomes that cover the leaves.</p>  <p>And while the industry frequently cited concerns over the cost and the possible environmental impact as rationales for not using the acid wash, UCLA researchers uncovered documents that they say indicate the reason may have been far different.</p>  <p>"The industry was concerned that the acid media would ionize the nicotine, making it more difficult to be absorbed into the brains of smokers and depriving them of that instant nicotine rush that fuels their addiction," Karagueuzian said. "The industry also were well aware that the curing of the tobacco leaves for more than a one-year period also would not eliminate the polonium-210, which has a half-life of 135 days, from the tobacco leaves because it was derived from its parent, lead-210, which has a half-life of 22 years."<em></em></p>  <div><p>Karagueuzian said the insoluble alpha particles bind with resins in the cigarette smoke and get stuck and accumulate at the bronchial bifurcations of the lungs, forming "hot spots," instead of dispersing throughout the lungs. In fact, previous research on lung autopsies in smokers who died of lung cancer showed that malignant growths were primarily located at the same bronchial bifurcations where these hot spots reside.</p></div> <p>"We used to think that only the chemicals in the cigarettes were causing lung cancer," Karagueuzian said. "But the case of the these hot spots, acknowledged by the industry and academia alike, makes a strong case for an increased probability of long-term development of malignancies caused by the alpha particles. If we're lucky, the alpha particle–irradiated cell dies. If it doesn't, it could mutate and become cancerous."</p>  <p>Karagueuzian said the findings are very timely in light of the June 2009 passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which grants the U.S. Food and Drug Administration broad authority to regulate and remove harmful substances — with the exception of nicotine — from tobacco products. The UCLA research, he said, makes a strong case that the FDA ought to consider making the removal of alpha particles from tobacco products a top priority.</p>  <p>"Such a move could have a considerable public health impact, due to the public's graphic perception of radiation hazards," he said.</p>  <p>To uncover the information, Karagueuzian and his team combed through the internal tobacco industry documents made available online as part of the landmark 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Documents from Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard, Brown I Williamson, the American Tobacco Company, the Tobacco Institutes and the Council for Tobacco Research, as well as the Bliley documents, were examined, Karagueuzian said.</p>  <p>The team searched for key terms such as "polonium-210," "atmospheric fallout," "bronchial epithelium," "hot particle" and "lung cancer," among others.</p>  <p>Karagueuzian said the earliest causal link between alpha particles and cancer was made around 1920, when alpha particle–emitting radium paint was used to paint luminescent numbers on watch dials. The painting was done by hand, and the workers commonly used their lips to produce a point on the tip of the paint brush. Many workers accumulated significant burdens of alpha particles through ingestion and absorption of radium-226 into the bones and subsequently developed jaw and mouth cancers. The practice was eventually discontinued.</p>  <p>Another example involves liver cancer in patients exposed to chronic low-dose internal alpha particles emitted from the poorly soluble deposits of thorium dioxide after receiving the contrast agent Thorotrast. It has been suggested that the liver cancers resulted from point mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 by the accumulated alpha particles present in the contrast media. The use of Thorotrast as contrast agent was stopped in the 1950s.</p>  <p>In addition to Karagueuzian, authors of the study include the late Amos Norman, professor emeritus in the departments of radiation oncology and radiological sciences at UCLA; James Sayre, of the departments of biostatistics and radiological sciences at UCLA; and Celia White, who served from 1999 to 2002 as director of content and services at the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library, which contains more than 13 million documents created by major tobacco companies related to their advertising, manufacturing, marketing, sales and scientific research activities.</p>  <p>The study was funded by the University of California Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program, established by the passage of California's SB1613 in 1989 to fund a comprehensive University of California grant program to support research into the prevention, causes and treatment of tobacco-related diseases.</p>  <p>The authors report no conflict of interest.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Cornell researcher and her colleagues have solved one key piece of the molecular puzzle needed to dramatically improve plant productivity and increase carbon sequestration: They have successfully transferred key regions of a highly efficient red algae into a tobacco plant, using bacteria as an intermediary.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-023-01436-7">study</a> was co-authored by <a href="https://cals.cornell.edu/laura-gunn">Laura Gunn</a>, assistant professor in the School of Integrative Plant Science Plant Biology Section in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and featured on the cover of the June 8 issue of Nature Plants.</p>
<p>The study centers on Rubisco, the most abundant protein across every ecosystem on Earth. Rubisco performs the first step of photosynthesis by fixing carbon, and it appears in various forms in a wide array of organisms, including plants, red and green algae and bacteria. Rubisco is slow and struggles to differentiate between oxygen and carbon dioxide, a problem Gunn and <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/08/scientists-take-step-improve-crops-photosynthesis-yields">several other Cornellians</a> are working on. As a result, Rubisco often limits plant growth and crop yield.</p>
<p>One species of red algae, Griffithsia monilis (Gm), contains Rubisco that is 30% more efficient at fixing carbon than Rubisco in other organisms, including terrestrial crops. For at least 20 years, scientists have been interested in transplanting the highly efficient GmRubisco into plants such as rice, wheat, soybean and tobacco to increase their productivity; however, until now, no one has been able to successfully coax plants to express it. This is because Rubisco requires multiple “chaperones” that are essential for the protein to fold, assemble and be active&nbsp; – there are seven such helpers in tobacco plants – and most of the chaperones in red algae are unknown, Gunn said.</p>
<p>In their study, Gunn and her co-authors were able to solve the 3D structure of GmRubisco and use this information to successfully graft a small number of regions from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RsRubisco) into a bacterial Rubisco.</p>
<p>“RsRubisco is not very efficient, but it is very closely related to GmRubisco – they’re like cousins – which means that unlike land-plant Rubisco, it accepts the grafted sequences,” Gunn said. “RsRubisco also doesn't need any special chaperones for it to fold and assemble in land plants.”</p>
<p>The change increased the carboxylation rate – the speed at which Rubisco starts the carbon fixation process – by 60%, increased carboxylation efficiency by 22% and improved RsRubisco’s ability to distinguish between carbon dioxide and oxygen by 7%. The authors then transplanted their bacterial mutant into tobacco, where it doubled photosynthesis and plant growth, compared to tobacco grown with unaltered RsRubisco. Tobacco is the easiest land plant in which to manipulate Rubisco and so serves as the test case for developing a more efficient Rubisco that can be transferred to more agronomically relevant species, Gunn said.</p>
<p>“We’re not at the point where we’re outperforming wild-type tobacco, but we’re on the right trajectory,” Gunn said. “We only need fairly modest improvements to Rubisco performance, because even a very small increase over a whole growing season can lead to massive changes in plant growth and yield, and the potential applications span many sectors: higher agricultural production; more efficient and affordable biofuel production; carbon sequestration approaches; and artificial energy possibilities.”</p>
<p>The research was supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Translational Photosynthesis, Formas Future Research Leaders and the European Regional Development Fund.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A few years ago I wrote <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/pygit/">pygit</a>, a small Python program that’s just enough of a Git client to create a repository, add some commits, and push itself to GitHub.</p>

<p>I wanted to compare what it would look like in Go, to see if it was reasonable to write small scripts in Go – quick ’n’ dirty code where performance isn’t a big deal, and stack traces are all you need for error handling.</p>

<p>The result is <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/gogit/blob/master/gogit.go">gogit</a>, a 400-line Go program that can initialise a repository, commit, and push to GitHub. It’s written in ordinary Go … except for error handling, which is just too verbose in idiomatic Go to work well for scripting (more on that <a href="#error-handling">below</a>).</p>

<h2 id="technical-summary">Technical summary</h2>

<p>I won’t go into detail about how Git works here (there’s a bit more in my <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/pygit/">pygit article</a>), suffice to say that the Git data model is pretty neat. It uses a simple file-based object store in <code>.git/objects</code>, where each object has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">40-character hash</a> and can be a <em>commit</em>, a <em>tree</em> (directory listing), or a <em>blob</em> (committed file). That’s it – the <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/gogit/blob/e94720d64dd93ca7aea17a314ea6430fc5f6b90c/gogit.go#L111-L164">gogit code</a> to write commits, trees, and blobs is about 50 lines.</p>

<p>I’ve implemented even less than pygit: only <code>init</code>, <code>commit</code>, and <code>push</code>. Gogit doesn’t even support the index (staging area), so instead of <code>gogit add</code>, you just <code>gogit commit</code> with the list of paths you want to commit each time. As <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/pygit/blob/aa8d8bb62ae273ae2f4f167e36f24f40a11634b9/pygit.py#L231-L246">pygit’s code</a> shows, dealing with the index is messy. It’s also unnecessary, and I wanted gogit to be an exercise in minimalism.</p>

<p>Gogit also drops the commands <code>cat-file</code>, <code>hash-object</code>, and <code>diff</code> – those aren’t required for committing and pushing to GitHub. I did use Git’s <code>cat-file</code> during debugging, however.</p>

<p>Here are the commands I used to create the repo, commit, and push to GitHub (note the use of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Compile_and_run_Go_program"><code>go run</code></a> to compile and execute the “script”):</p>

<div><pre><code># Initialise the repo
$ go run . init

# Make the first commit (other commits are similar)
$ export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME='Ben Hoyt'
$ export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=benhoyt@gmail.com
$ go run . commit -m 'Initial commit' gogit.go go.mod LICENSE.txt
commited 0580a17 to master

# Push updates to GitHub
$ export GIT_USERNAME=benhoyt
$ export GIT_PASSWORD=...
$ go run . push https://github.com/benhoyt/gogit
updating remote master from 0000000 to 0580a17 (5 objects)
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>

<p>The verbosity of Go’s error handling has been much-maligned. It’s simple and explicit, but every call to a function that may fail takes an additional three lines of code to handle the error:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>mode</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>strconv</span><span>.</span><span>ParseInt</span><span>(</span><span>modeStr</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>64</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>err</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It’s not as big a deal when writing production code, because then you want more control over error handling anyway – nicely-wrapped errors, or human-readable messages, for example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>mode</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>strconv</span><span>.</span><span>ParseInt</span><span>(</span><span>modeStr</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>64</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Errorf</span><span>(</span><span>"mode must be an octal number, not %q"</span><span>,</span> <span>modeStr</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In a simple script, however, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/6v63c2/comment/dly1pis/">all the error handling you need</a> is to show a message, print a stack trace, and exit the program. That’s what happens in Python when you don’t catch exceptions, and it’s easy to emulate in Go with a <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/gogit/blob/e94720d64dd93ca7aea17a314ea6430fc5f6b90c/gogit.go#L84-L101">couple of helper functions</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>check0</span><span>(</span><span>err</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>panic</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>check</span><span>[</span><span>T</span> <span>any</span><span>](</span><span>value</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>panic</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>value</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>assert</span><span>(</span><span>cond</span> <span>bool</span><span>,</span> <span>format</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span> <span>...</span><span>any</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>!</span><span>cond</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>panic</span><span>(</span><span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Sprintf</span><span>(</span><span>format</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>...</span><span>))</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now that Go has generics you can easily define a <code>check</code> function which returns a result. However, you still need variants based on the number of results returned. Normally this is zero or one, with one being most common, so I’ve named that variant just <code>check</code>, and the zero-results one <code>check0</code>. I’ve also defined <code>assert</code>, which takes a boolean and a formatted message instead of an error.</p>

<p>These helpers allow you to turn this code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>writeTree</span><span>(</span><span>paths</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>([]</span><span>byte</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>st</span><span>.</span><span>IsDir</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>panic</span><span>(</span><span>"sub-trees not supported"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>ReadFile</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>hash</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>hashObject</span><span>(</span><span>"blob"</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>"%o %s</span><span>\x00</span><span>%s"</span><span>,</span> <span>st</span><span>.</span><span>Mode</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>Perm</span><span>()</span><span>|</span><span>0</span><span>o100000</span><span>,</span> <span>path</span><span>,</span> <span>hash</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>hashObject</span><span>(</span><span>"tree"</span><span>,</span> <span>buf</span><span>.</span><span>Bytes</span><span>())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Into the following, reducing the function body from 21 to 10 lines, which is comparable to the brevity of Python:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>writeTree</span><span>(</span><span>paths</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>var</span> <span>buf</span> <span>bytes</span><span>.</span><span>Buffer</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>path</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>paths</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>st</span> <span>:=</span> <span>check</span><span>(</span><span>os</span><span>.</span><span>Stat</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>))</span>
        <span>assert</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>st</span><span>.</span><span>IsDir</span><span>(),</span> <span>"sub-trees not supported"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>data</span> <span>:=</span> <span>check</span><span>(</span><span>os</span><span>.</span><span>ReadFile</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>))</span>
        <span>hash</span> <span>:=</span> <span>hashObject</span><span>(</span><span>"blob"</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>)</span>
        <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>"%o %s</span><span>\x00</span><span>%s"</span><span>,</span> <span>st</span><span>.</span><span>Mode</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>Perm</span><span>()</span><span>|</span><span>0</span><span>o100000</span><span>,</span> <span>path</span><span>,</span> <span>hash</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>hashObject</span><span>(</span><span>"tree"</span><span>,</span> <span>buf</span><span>.</span><span>Bytes</span><span>())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It’s not perfect, because the word <code>check</code> slightly obscures the function you’re calling, but it does makes writing quick ’n’ dirty scripts a lot nicer.</p>

<p>You even get “better” errors than a plain <code>return err</code>, because the stack trace shows you exactly what function and line of code was being executed:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ go run . push https://github.com/benhoyt/gogit
panic: Get "https://github.com/benhoyt/gogit/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack":

<p><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/gogit/commit/ad75a5fbf67924d5a62dc9794e772d069610d085">Changing from <code>return err</code> to <code>check</code></a> reduced the number of lines of code from 607 to 415, a reduction by 32%.</p>

<p>If you want to pursue this approach further, there’s even a library written by Joe Tsai and Josh Bleecher Snyder called <a href="https://github.com/dsnet/try"><code>try</code></a> that uses <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/builtin#recover"><code>recover</code></a> to do this “properly”. Interesting stuff! I’m still hoping the Go team figures out a way to make error handling less verbose.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>This is going to be a short section, because I don’t care about speed in this program, and the Go version is likely as fast or faster than the Python version. Go can be significantly faster, but we’re dealing with tiny files, and in Python, all the interesting code like hashing and writing to disk is written in C anyway.</p>

<p>Memory usage is another aspect of performance. Again, we’re dealing with small files here, so it’s not an issue to read everything into memory. In Python, you can do streaming, but it’s not as consistently easy as in Go, due to the amazing <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/io#Reader"><code>io.Reader</code></a> and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/io#Writer"><code>io.Writer</code></a> interfaces.</p>

<p>That said, it’s still a bit easier in Go to read everything into <code>[]byte</code> or <code>string</code> and operate on those, so that’s what I’ve done in gogit. We’re talking about a few KB of memory, and my machine has a few GB.</p>

<h2 id="comparison-with-python-version">Comparison with Python version</h2>

<p>As it stands, Pygit is about 600 lines of code, and gogit about 400. However, that’s a bit misleading, as I removed several features when writing the Go version: there’s no support for the Git index, and there’s no <code>cat-file</code>, <code>hash-object</code>, or <code>diff</code>.</p>

<p>I did a quick test by removing those functions from the Python version, and it ends up at 360 lines of code. I consider 400 in Go versus 360 in Python not bad – it’s only 10% longer. And the Go version includes 20 lines of imports and 20 lines for the check/assert functions. So they’re really almost identical in size!</p>

<p>Let’s look at a couple of specific functions. First, <code>find_object</code>, which looks in the Git object store to find an object with the given prefix. Here’s the Python version:</p>

<p>A lot of things are similar, for example the <code>os.path.join</code> vs <code>filepath.Join</code>, <code>os.listdir</code> vs <code>os.ReadDir</code>, and so on. But note the list comprehension in Python – a one-liner – is a five-line <code>for</code> loop in Go. I do miss list comprehensions when scripting in Go…</p>

<p>Let’s look at another one, the <code>commit</code> function, first in Python:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Interestingly, this time the Python version is longer: 23 lines versus Go’s 19. This mostly comes down to the better handling of timestamps. Go’s standard library isn’t perfect, but its <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/time"><code>time</code></a> package is better than Python’s <code>time</code> and <code>datetime</code> packages put together.</p>

<p>In general, Go’s standard library seems much more coherent and better-designed than Python’s, which feels like it was designed by many different people over several decades (because it was).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>When used with <code>panic</code>-based error handling, Go is good for writing quick ’n’ dirty command line scripts.</p>

<p>To be honest, I’d still probably reach for Python first for throwaway scripts, because of its terser syntax, list (and other) comprehensions, and exception handling by default.</p>

<p>However, for anything more than a throwaway script, I’d quickly move to Go. Its standard library is better-designed, its <code>io.Reader</code> and <code>io.Writer</code> interfaces are excellent, and its lightweight static typing helps catch bugs without getting in the way.</p>

<p>I’d love it if you <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/benhoyt/">sponsored me on GitHub</a> – it will motivate me to work on my open source projects and write more good content. Thanks!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-testid="paragraph-0">(Reuters) - A new report adds to a growing line of research showing that police departments don’t solve serious or violent crimes with any regularity, and in fact, spend very little time on crime control, in contrast to popular narratives.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-1">The <a data-testid="Link" href="https://catalyst-ca.cdn.prismic.io/catalyst-ca/126c30a8-852c-416a-b8a7-55a90c77a04e_APCA+ACLU+REIMAGINING+COMMUNITY+SAFETY+2022_5.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> was published Oct. 25 by advocacy group Catalyst California and the ACLU of Southern California. It relies on county budgets' numbers and new policing data provided under the state’s Racial and Identity Profiling Act, which took effect in 2019.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">The law requires police to report demographic and other basic information about their work, including the duration of a stop and what actions were taken, like ordering someone out of a car.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">Records provided by the sheriff’s departments in Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and Riverside showed the same longstanding pattern of racial disparities in police stops throughout the country for decades. Black people in San Diego were more than twice as likely than white residents to be stopped by sheriff’s deputies, for example.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">More notably, researchers analyzed the data to show how officers spend their time, and the patterns that emerge tell a striking story about how policing actually works. Those results, too, comport with existing research showing that U.S. police spend much of their time conducting racially biased stops and searches of minority drivers, often without reasonable suspicion, rather than “fighting crime.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Overall, sheriff patrol officers spend significantly more time on officer-initiated stops – “proactive policing” in law enforcement parlance – than they do responding to community members’ calls for help, according to the report. Research has shown that the practice is a fundamentally ineffective public safety strategy, the report pointed out.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">In 2019, 88% of the time L.A. County sheriff’s officers spent on stops was for officer-initiated stops rather than in response to calls. The overwhelming majority of that time – 79% – was spent on traffic violations. By contrast, just 11% of those hours was spent on stops based on reasonable suspicion of a crime.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">In Riverside, about 83% of deputies’ time spent on officer-initiated stops went toward traffic violations, and just 7% on stops based on reasonable suspicion.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Moreover, most of the stops are pointless, other than inconveniencing citizens, or worse – “a routine practice of pretextual stops,” researchers wrote. Roughly three out of every four hours that Sacramento sheriff’s officers spent investigating traffic violations were for stops that ended in warnings, or no action, for example.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Researchers calculated that more of the departments’ budgets go toward fruitless traffic stops than responses to service calls -- essentially wasting millions of public dollars.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Chauncee Smith, a senior manager at Catalyst California, told me they wanted to test the dominant media and political narrative that police agencies use public funds to keep communities safe.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">“We found there is a significant inconsistency between their practices” and what the public might think police do, Smith said. “It begs the question of why we keep doubling down on public safety strategies that have been proven time and time again to fail.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">The departments were mostly non-responsive to my questions.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">Riverside Sheriff Chad Bianco said the data -- which is self-reported -- is flawed. All four departments declined to answer specific questions about how officers spend their time, and didn’t provide contradictory information.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">The prevailing political myth about police work was echoed again in August, when President Joe Biden announced his administration’s <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/bidens-crime-prevention-plan-repeats-old-mistakes-policing-2022-08-02/">“fund the police” measure</a> to support hiring more cops around the country over the next five years.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">“When it comes to fighting crime, we know what works: officers on the street who know the neighborhood,” Biden said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">Most of the existing research flatly contradicts that account.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">In 2016, a group of criminologists conducted a <a data-testid="Link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11292-016-9269-8" target="_blank">systematic review</a> of 62 earlier studies of police force size and crime between 1971 and 2013. They concluded that 40 years of studies consistently show that “the overall effect size for police force size on crime is negative, small, and not statistically significant.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">“This line of research has exhausted its utility,” the authors wrote. “Changing policing strategy is likely to have a greater impact on crime than adding more police.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19">Decades of data similarly shows that police don’t solve much serious and violent crime – the safety issues that most concern everyday people.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-20">Over the past decade, “consistently less than half of all violent crime and less than twenty-five percent of all property crime were cleared,” William Laufer and Robert Hughes wrote in a 2021 law review <a data-testid="Link" href="https://tmsnrt.rs/3DOcF3g" target="_blank">article</a>. Laufer and Hughes are professors in the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania’s Legal Studies and Business Ethics Department.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-21">Police “have never successfully solved crimes with any regularity, as arrest and clearance rates are consistently low throughout history,” and police have never solved even a bare majority of serious crimes, University of Utah college of law professor Shima Baradaran Baughman wrote in another 2021 law review <a data-testid="Link" href="https://tmsnrt.rs/3UbfhNO" target="_blank">article</a>, including murder, rape, burglary and robbery.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-22">Existing research also affirms the findings in the recent report on police work in California.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-23">Law “enforcement is a relatively small part of what police do every day,” Barry Friedman, a law professor at the New York University School of Law wrote in a 2021 law review <a data-testid="Link" href="https://tmsnrt.rs/3UdsxSe" target="_blank">article</a>.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-24">Studies have shown that the average police officer spent about one hour per week responding to crimes in progress, Friedman wrote.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-25">Police spend most of their time on traffic violations and routine, minor issues, like noise complaints, according to three different, recent analyses of dispatch data from <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-05/lapd-911-calls-reimagining-police" target="_blank">Los Angeles</a>, <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.vera.org/news/most-911-calls-have-nothing-to-do-with-crime-why-are-we-still-sending-police" target="_blank">Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Seattle</a>, and <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/article/police_dispatch_stats" target="_blank">New Haven, Connecticut</a>.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-26">The New York Times reviewed national dispatch data from the FBI in June 2020, and found that just 4% of officers’ time is devoted to violent crime.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-27">“We hope the report helps reshape the narrative about the relationship between law enforcement and safety,” Smith told me. Californians “should understand that a reimagination of community safety is far overdue and that equitable and community-centered solutions” are more effective alternatives.</p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p><p>Opinions expressed are those of the author.
