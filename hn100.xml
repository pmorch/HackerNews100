                                        <p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Intel is pivoting its strategy to enable ecosystem partners to continue NUC systems product line innovation and growth. ASUS’s expertise and track record delivering industry-leading mini PCs to customers make it ideally suited to continue driving innovation and growth in NUC systems products.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Intel, for your confidence in us to take the NUC systems product line forward. I am confident that this collaboration will enhance and accelerate our vision for the mini PC – greatly expanding our footprint in areas such as AI and AIoT,” said Joe Hsieh, ASUS chief operating officer. “We are committed to ensuring the excellent support and service that NUC systems customers expect.”</p>

<p><strong>What’s Next: </strong>Under the proposed agreement, ASUS will receive a non-exclusive license to Intel’s NUC systems product line designs, enabling it to manufacture and sell 10th to 13th Gen NUC systems products and develop future designs. This will enable ASUS to provide product and support continuity for Intel NUC systems customers. ASUS will establish a new business unit called ASUS NUC BU.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Elevator Pitch</h2>
<p dir="auto">Minor rant incoming: Something's not working? Maybe a service is down. <code>docker-compose ps</code>. Yep, it's that microservice that's still buggy. No issue, I'll just restart it: <code>docker-compose restart</code>. Okay now let's try again. Oh wait the issue is still there. Hmm. <code>docker-compose ps</code>. Right so the service must have just stopped immediately after starting. I probably would have known that if I was reading the log stream, but there is a lot of clutter in there from other services. I could get the logs for just that one service with <code>docker compose logs --follow myservice</code> but that dies everytime the service dies so I'd need to run that command every time I restart the service. I could alternatively run <code>docker-compose up myservice</code> and in that terminal window if the service is down I could just <code>up</code> it again, but now I've got one service hogging a terminal window even after I no longer care about its logs. I guess when I want to reclaim the terminal realestate I can do <code>ctrl+P,Q</code>, but... wait, that's not working for some reason. Should I use ctrl+C instead? I can't remember if that closes the foreground process or kills the actual service.</p>
<p dir="auto">What a headache!</p>
<p dir="auto">Memorising docker commands is hard. Memorising aliases is slightly less hard. Keeping track of your containers across multiple terminal windows is near impossible. What if you had all the information you needed in one terminal window with every common command living one keypress away (and the ability to add custom commands as well). Lazydocker's goal is to make that dream a reality.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How do I edit my config?</h3>
<p dir="auto">By opening lazydocker, clicking on the 'project' panel in the top left, and pressing 'o' (or 'e' if your editor is vim). See <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/blob/master/docs/Config.md">Config Docs</a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How do I get text to wrap in my main panel?</h3>
<p dir="auto">In the future I want to make this the default, but for now there are some CPU issues that arise with wrapping. If you want to enable wrapping, use <code>gui.wrapMainPanel: true</code></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How do you select text?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Because we support mouse events, you will need to hold option while dragging the mouse to indicate you're trying to select text rather than click on something. Alternatively you can disable mouse events via the <code>gui.ignoreMouseEvents</code> config value.</p>
<p dir="auto">Mac Users: See <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/issues/190" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/jesseduffield/lazydocker/issues/190/hovercard">Issue #190</a> for other options.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why can't I see my container's logs?</h3>
<p dir="auto">By default we only show logs from the last hour, so that we're not putting too much strain on the machine. This may be why you can't see logs when you first start lazydocker. This can be overwritten in the config's <code>commandTemplates</code></p>
<p dir="auto">If you are running lazydocker in Docker container, it is a know bug, that you can't see logs or CPU usage.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why isn't my docker-compose environment being used?</h3>
<p dir="auto">By default Compose V1 (<code>docker-compose</code> with the hyphen) is used as the docker-compose command. You will need to make sure you have the <code>docker-compose</code> command available for lazydocker to be able to use.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you use Compose V2 (<code>docker compose</code> without the hyphen), alternatively, you can change the docker-compose command used via the <code>commandTemplates.dockerCompose</code> config value.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Alternatives</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/skanehira/docui">docui</a> - Skanehira beat me to the punch on making a docker terminal UI, so definitely check out that repo as well! I think the two repos can live in harmony though: lazydocker is more about managing existing containers/services, and docui is more about creating and configuring them.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/portainer/portainer">Portainer</a> - Portainer tries to solve the same problem but it's accessed via your browser rather than your terminal. It also supports docker swarm.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker/blob/master/README.md#terminal">Awesome Docker list</a> for similar tools to work with Docker.</li>

<h2>3.0.0 unified release notes<a href="#unified-release-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cython 3.0.0 has been a very large effort that cleaned up many old warts,
introduced many new features, and introduces a couple of intentional
behaviour changes, even though the goal remained to stay compatible as
much as possible with Cython 0.29.x. For details, see the <a href="https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/migrating_to_cy30.html">migration guide</a>.</p>
<p>As the development was spread out over several years, a lot of things have
happened in the meantime. Many crucial bugfixes and some features were
backported to 0.29.x and are not strictly speaking “new” in Cython 3.0.0.</p>

<h3>Compatibility with Python<a href="#compatibility-with-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since Cython 3.0.0 started development, CPython 3.8-3.11 were released.
All these are supported in Cython, including experimental support for the
in-development CPython 3.12. On the other end of the spectrum, support for
Python 2.6 was dropped.</p>
<p>Cython interacts very closely with the C-API of Python, which is where most
of the adaptation work happens. Independently, Cython strives to be able to
parse newer Python constructs for use with its <a href="https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html">pure python</a> mode, which
has been a focus. In short, this allows to compile a wider range of Python
code into optimized C code.</p>

<h3>Initial support for Limited API<a href="#initial-support-for-limited-api" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CPython provides a stable, limited subset of its C-API as the so-called Limited API.
This C-API comes with the guarantee of a stable ABI, meaning that extensions modules
that were compiled for one version of CPython can also be imported in later versions
without recompilation.</p>
<p>There is initial support for this in Cython.  By defining the <code><span>CYTHON_LIMITED_API</span></code>
macro, Cython cuts down its C-API usage and tries to adhere to the Limited C-API.
By also defining the CPython macro <code><span>Py_LIMITED_API</span></code> to a specific CPython
compatibility version, you can additionally restrict the C-API during the C compilation,
thus enforcing the forward compatibility of the extension module, probably at the cost
of a bit of performance.</p>
<p>Note that “initial support” in Cython really means that setting the <code><span>Py_LIMITED_API</span></code>
macro may not work for your specific code.  There are limitations in the Limited C-API
that are difficult for Cython to generate C code for, so some advanced Python features
(like async code) may not lead to C code that cannot adhere to the Limited C-API, or
where Cython simply does not know yet how to adhere to it.  Basically, if you get your
code to compile with both macros set, and it passes your test suite, then it should be
possible to import the extension module also in later CPython versions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Preliminary support for the CPython’s <code><span>Py_LIMITED_API</span></code> (stable ABI) is
available by setting the  <code><span>CYTHON_LIMITED_API</span></code> C macro.  Note that the
support is currently in an early stage and many features do not yet work.
You currently still have to define <code><span>Py_LIMITED_API</span></code> externally in order
to restrict the API usage.  This will change when the feature stabilises.

<p>Cython has gained several major new features that speed up both the development

the dataclass features in C code.  Similarly, the <code><span>@functools.total_ordering</span></code>
decorator to an extension type will implement the comparison functions in C.</p>
<p>Finally, NumPy ufuncs can be generated from simple computation functions with the
new <code><span>@cython.ufunc</span></code> decorator.</p>

<li><p>The <code><span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span></code> and <code><span>extern</span> <span>"C++"</span></code> markers that Cython generates for
<code><span>public</span></code> functions can now be controlled by setting the C macro <code><span>CYTHON_EXTERN_C</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Python <code><span>int</span></code> handling code was adapted to make use of the new <code><span>PyLong</span></code>
internals in CPython 3.12.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5353">#5353</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Conversion of Python ints to C <code><span>int128</span></code> is now always supported, although slow
if dedicated C-API support is missing (<code><span>_PyLong_AsByteArray()</span></code>), specifically in
the Limited C-API.

<li><p>The normal <code><span>@dataclasses.dataclass</span></code> and <code><span>@functools.total_ordering</span></code> decorators
can now be used on extension types.  Using the corresponding <code><span>@cython.*</span></code> decorator
will automatically turn a Python class into an extension type (no need for <code><span>@cclass</span></code>).

<li><p>ctuples can now be assigned from arbitrary sequences, not just Python tuples.</p></li>
<li><p>A new directive <code><span>embedsignature.format</span></code> was added to select the format of the
docstring embedded signatures between <code><span>python</span></code>, <code><span>c</span></code> and argument <code><span>clinic</span></code>.

together with <code><span>@cfunc</span></code>, and applying <code><span>@cfunc</span></code> to a <code><span>@ufunc</span></code>.  Cython also
warns now when a directive is applied needlessly.

<section id="id18">
<h3>Features added<a href="#id18" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Cython implemented C functions now propagate exceptions by default, rather than
swallowing them in non-object returning function if the user forgot to add an
<code><span>except</span></code> declaration to the signature.  This was a long-standing source of bugs,
but can require adding the <code><span>noexcept</span></code> declaration to existing functions if
exception propagation is really undesired.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4280">#4280</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>To opt out of the new, safer exception handling behaviour, legacy code can set the new
directive <code><span>legacy_implicit_noexcept=True</span></code> for a transition period to keep the
previous, unsafe behaviour.  This directive will eventually be removed in a later release.
Patch by Matúš Valo.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5094">#5094</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>A new function decorator <code><span>@cython.ufunc</span></code> automatically generates a (NumPy) ufunc that
applies the calculation function to an entire memoryview.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4758">#4758</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>**</span></code> power operator now behaves more like in Python by returning the correct complex
result if required by math.  A new <code><span>cpow</span></code> directive was added to turn on the previous
C-like behaviour.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4936">#4936</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The special <code><span>__*pow__</span></code> methods now support the 2- and 3-argument variants.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5160">#5160</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Unknown type annotations (e.g. because of typos) now emit a warning at compile time.
Patch by Matúš Valo.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5070">#5070</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Subscripted builtin types in type declarations (like <code><span>list[float]</span></code>) are now
better supported.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5058">#5058</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Python’s <code><span>memoryview</span></code> is now a known builtin type with optimised properties.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3798">#3798</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The call-time dispatch for fused memoryview types is less slow.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5073">#5073</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Integer comparisons avoid Python coercions if possible.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4821">#4821</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The Python Enum of a <code><span>cpdef</span> <span>enum</span></code> now inherits from <code><span>IntFlag</span></code> to better match
both Python and C semantics of enums.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2732">#2732</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0614/">PEP-614</a>:
decorators can now be arbitrary Python expressions.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4570">#4570</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>cpdef</span></code> enums can now be pickled.

Patch by Matúš Valo.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1662">#1662</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>reversed()</span></code> can now be used together with C++ iteration.
Patch by Chia-Hsiang Cheng.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5002">#5002</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Standard C/C++ atomic operations are now used for memory views, if available.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4925">#4925</a>)</p></li>

<li><p><code><span>cpp_locals</span></code> no longer have to be “assignable”.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4558">#4558</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>cythonize</span> <span>--help</span></code> now also prints information about the supported environment variables.

<li><p>Type annotations for Python <code><span>int</span></code> rejected <code><span>long</span></code> under Py2 in the alpha-11 release.
They are now ignored again (as always before) when <code><span>language_level=2</span></code>, and accept
both <code><span>int</span></code> and <code><span>long</span></code> in Py2 (and only <code><span>int</span></code> in Py3) otherwise.

<ul>
<li><p>The undocumented, untested and apparently useless syntax
<code><span>from</span> <span>somemodule</span> <span>cimport</span> <span>class/struct/union</span> <span>somename</span></code> was removed.  The type
modifier is not needed here and a plain <code><span>cimport</span></code> of the name will do.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4904">#4904</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>C-style array declarations (<code><span>cdef</span> <span>int</span> <span>a[4]</span></code>) are now (silently) deprecated in
favour of the Java-style <code><span>cdef</span> <span>int[4]</span> <span>a</span></code> form.  The latter was always available
and the Python type declaration syntax already used it exclusively (<code><span>a:</span> <span>int[4]</span></code>).

Patch by Thomas Li.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4736">#4736</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Wheels now include a compiled parser again, which increases their size a little
but gives about a 10% speed-up when running Cython.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>Tempita</span></code> module no longer contains HTML processing capabilities, which
were found to be broken in Python 3.8 and later.

<ul>
<li><p>When using type annotations, <code><span>func(x:</span> <span>list)</span></code> or <code><span>func(x:</span> <span>ExtType)</span></code> (and other
Python builtin or extension types) no longer allow <code><span>None</span></code> as input argument to <code><span>x</span></code>.
This is consistent with the normal typing semantics in Python, and was a common gotcha
for users who did not expect <code><span>None</span></code> to be allowed as input.  To allow <code><span>None</span></code>, use
<code><span>typing.Optional</span></code> as in <code><span>func(x:</span> <span>Optional[list])</span></code>.  <code><span>None</span></code> is also automatically
allowed when it is used as default argument, i.e. <code><span>func(x:</span> <span>list</span> <span>=</span> <span>None)</span></code>.
<code><span>int</span></code> and <code><span>float</span></code> are now also recognised in type annotations and restrict the
value type at runtime.  They were previously ignored.
Note that, for backwards compatibility reasons, the new behaviour does not apply when using
Cython’s C notation, as in <code><span>func(list</span> <span>x)</span></code>.  Here, <code><span>None</span></code> is still allowed, as always.
Also, the <code><span>annotation_typing</span></code> directive can now be enabled and disabled more finely
within the module.

<li><p>The compile-time <code><span>DEF</span></code> and <code><span>IF</span></code> statements are deprecated and generate a warning.
They should be replaced with normal constants, code generation or C macros.

<section id="id36">
<h3>Features added<a href="#id36" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Special methods for binary operators now follow Python semantics.
Rather than e.g. a single <code><span>__add__</span></code> method for cdef classes, where
“self” can be either the first or second argument, one can now define
both <code><span>__add__</span></code> and <code><span>__radd__</span></code> as for standard Python classes.
This behavior can be disabled with the <code><span>c_api_binop_methods</span></code> directive
to return to the previous semantics in Cython code (available from Cython
0.29.20), or the reversed method (<code><span>__radd__</span></code>) can be implemented in
addition to an existing two-sided operator method (<code><span>__add__</span></code>) to get a
backwards compatible implementation.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2056">#2056</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>No/single argument functions now accept keyword arguments by default in order
to comply with Python semantics.  The marginally faster calling conventions
<code><span>METH_NOARGS</span></code> and <code><span>METH_O</span></code> that reject keyword arguments are still available
with the directive <code><span>@cython.always_allow_keywords(False)</span></code>.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3090">#3090</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>For-in-loop iteration over <code><span>bytearray</span></code> and memory views is optimised.
Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2227">#2227</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Type inference now works for memory views and slices.
Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2227">#2227</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>@returns()</span></code> decorator propagates exceptions by default for suitable C
return types when no <code><span>@exceptval()</span></code> is defined.
(Github issues <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3625">#3625</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3664">#3664</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>A low-level inline function <code><span>total_seconds(timedelta)</span></code> was added to
<code><span>cpython.datetime</span></code> to bypass the Python method call.  Note that this function
is not guaranteed to give exactly the same results for very large time intervals.
Patch by Brock Mendel.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3616">#3616</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Type inference now understands that <code><span>a,</span> <span>*b</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span></code> assigns a list to <code><span>b</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Limited API support was improved.

are now qualified with the module name of the internal Cython module that is
used for sharing them across Cython implemented modules, for example
<code><span>_cython_3_0a5.coroutine</span></code>.  This was done to avoid making them look like

<li><p>With <code><span>language_level=3/3str</span></code>, Python classes without explicit base class
are now new-style (type) classes also in Py2.  Previously, they were created

<h3>Features added<a href="#id48" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Cython functions now use the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0590">PEP-590</a> vectorcall protocol in Py3.7+.
Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2263">#2263</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Unicode identifiers are supported in Cython code (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3131">PEP-3131</a>).
Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2601">#2601</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Unicode module names and imports are supported.
Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3119">#3119</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Annotations are no longer parsed, keeping them as strings following <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563">PEP-563</a>.
Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3285">#3285</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Preliminary support for the CPython’s <code><span>Py_LIMITED_API</span></code> (stable ABI) is
available by setting the  <code><span>CYTHON_LIMITED_API</span></code> C macro.  Note that the
support is currently in an early stage and many features do not yet work.
You currently still have to define <code><span>Py_LIMITED_API</span></code> externally in order
to restrict the API usage.  This will change when the feature stabilises.

<li><p>The dispatch to fused functions is now linear in the number of arguments,
which makes it much faster, often 2x or more, and several times faster for
larger fused types with many specialisations.
Patch by will-ca.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1385">#1385</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>with</span> <span>gil/nogil</span></code> statements can be conditional based on compile-time

but we already have a fresh one.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3494">#3494</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Extension types that do not need their own <code><span>tp_new</span></code> implementation (because
they have no object attributes etc.) directly inherit the implementation of
their parent type if possible.

incorrectly optimised for single character input values and only returned
the first character if multiple characters should have been returned.

<li><p>Diverging from the usual behaviour, <code><span>len(memoryview)</span></code>, <code><span>len(char*)</span></code>
and <code><span>len(Py_UNICODE*)</span></code> returned an unsigned <code><span>size_t</span></code> value.  They now

<li><p>Item access (subscripting) with integer indices/keys always tried the
Sequence protocol before the Mapping protocol, which diverged from Python

<h3>Other changes<a href="#id50" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The default language level was changed to <code><span>3str</span></code>, i.e. Python 3 semantics,
but with <code><span>str</span></code> literals (also in Python 2.7).  This is a backwards incompatible
change from the previous default of Python 2 semantics.  The previous behaviour
is available through the directive <code><span>language_level=2</span></code>.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2565">#2565</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Cython no longer generates <code><span>__qualname__</span></code> attributes for classes in Python
2.x since they are problematic there and not correctly maintained for subclasses.
Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2772">#2772</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Source file fingerprinting now uses SHA-1 instead of MD5 since the latter
tends to be slower and less widely supported these days.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2790">#2790</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The long deprecated include files <code><span>python_*</span></code>, <code><span>stdio</span></code>, <code><span>stdlib</span></code> and
<code><span>stl</span></code> in <code><span>Cython/Includes/Deprecated/</span></code> were removed.  Use the <code><span>libc.*</span></code>
and <code><span>cpython.*</span></code> pxd modules instead.
Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2904">#2904</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The search order for include files was changed. Previously it was
<code><span>include_directories</span></code>, <code><span>Cython/Includes</span></code>, <code><span>sys.path</span></code>. Now it is
<code><span>include_directories</span></code>, <code><span>sys.path</span></code>, <code><span>Cython/Includes</span></code>. This was done to
allow third-party <code><span>*.pxd</span></code> files to override the ones in Cython.
Patch by Matti Picus.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2905">#2905</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The command line parser was rewritten and modernised using <code><span>argparse</span></code>.

<li><p>The deprecated <code><span>PyUnicode_*()</span></code> C-API functions are no longer used, except for Unicode
strings that contain lone surrogates.  Unicode strings that contain non-BMP characters
or surrogate pairs now generate different C code on 16-bit Python 2.x Unicode deployments
(such as MS-Windows).  Generating the C code on Python 3.x is recommended in this case.

<li><p>The search order for include files was changed. Previously it was
<code><span>include_directories</span></code>, <code><span>Cython/Includes</span></code>, <code><span>sys.path</span></code>. Now it is
<code><span>include_directories</span></code>, <code><span>sys.path</span></code>, <code><span>Cython/Includes</span></code>. This was done to
allow third-party <code><span>*.pxd</span></code> files to override the ones in Cython.

<section id="id164">
<h3>Features added<a href="#id164" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>PEP-489 multi-phase module initialisation has been enabled again.  Module
reloads in other subinterpreters raise an exception to prevent corruption
of the static module state.</p></li>
<li><p>A set of <code><span>mypy</span></code> compatible PEP-484 declarations were added for Cython’s C data
types to integrate with static analysers in typed Python code.  They are available
in the <code><span>Cython/Shadow.pyi</span></code> module and describe the types in the special <code><span>cython</span></code>
module that can be used for typing in Python code.
Original patch by Julian Gethmann. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1965">#1965</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Memoryviews are supported in PEP-484/526 style type declarations.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2529">#2529</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>@cython.nogil</span></code> is supported as a C-function decorator in Python code.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2557">#2557</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Raising exceptions from nogil code will automatically acquire the GIL, instead
of requiring an explicit <code><span>with</span> <span>gil</span></code> block.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ functions can now be declared as potentially raising both C++ and Python
exceptions, so that Cython can handle both correctly.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2615">#2615</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>cython.inline()</span></code> supports a direct <code><span>language_level</span></code> keyword argument that
was previously only available via a directive.</p></li>
<li><p>A new language level name <code><span>3str</span></code> was added that mostly corresponds to language
level 3, but keeps unprefixed string literals as type ‘str’ in both Py2 and Py3,
and the builtin ‘str’ type unchanged.  This will become the default in the next
Cython release and is meant to help user code a) transition more easily to this
new default and b) migrate to Python 3 source code semantics without making support
for Python 2.x difficult.</p></li>
<li><p>In CPython 3.6 and later, looking up globals in the module dict is almost
as fast as looking up C globals.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2313">#2313</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>For a Python subclass of an extension type, repeated method calls to non-overridden
cpdef methods can avoid the attribute lookup in Py3.6+, which makes them 4x faster.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2313">#2313</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>(In-)equality comparisons of objects to integer literals are faster.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2188">#2188</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Some internal and 1-argument method calls are faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Modules that cimport many external extension types from other Cython modules
execute less import requests during module initialisation.</p></li>
<li><p>Constant tuples and slices are deduplicated and only created once per module.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2292">#2292</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The coverage plugin considers more C file extensions such as <code><span>.cc</span></code> and <code><span>.cxx</span></code>.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2266">#2266</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>cythonize</span></code> command accepts compile time variable values (as set by <code><span>DEF</span></code>)
through the new <code><span>-E</span></code> option.
Patch by Jerome Kieffer.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2315">#2315</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>pyximport</span></code> can import from namespace packages.
Patch by Prakhar Goel.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2294">#2294</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Some missing numpy and CPython C-API declarations were added.
Patch by John Kirkham. (Github issues <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2523">#2523</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2520">#2520</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2537">#2537</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Declarations for the <code><span>pylifecycle</span></code> C-API functions were added in a new .pxd file
<code><span>cpython.pylifecycle</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Pythran support was updated to work with the latest Pythran 0.8.7.
Original patch by Adrien Guinet.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2600">#2600</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>%a</span></code> is included in the string formatting types that are optimised into f-strings.
In this case, it is also automatically mapped to <code><span>%r</span></code> in Python 2.x.</p></li>
<li><p>New C macro <code><span>CYTHON_HEX_VERSION</span></code> to access Cython’s version in the same style as
<code><span>PY_VERSION_HEX</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Constants in <code><span>libc.math</span></code> are now declared as <code><span>const</span></code> to simplify their handling.</p></li>
<li><p>An additional <code><span>check_size</span></code> clause was added to the <code><span>ctypedef</span> <span>class</span></code> name
specification to allow suppressing warnings when importing modules with
backwards-compatible <code><span>PyTypeObject</span></code> size changes.

<li><p>The exception handling in generators and coroutines under CPython 3.7 was adapted

module state. It now raises an exception instead, given that reloading is
not actually supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Object-returning, C++ exception throwing functions were not checking that

<li><p>Cython now emits a warning when no <code><span>language_level</span></code> (2, 3 or ‘3str’) is set
explicitly, neither as a <code><span>cythonize()</span></code> option nor as a compiler directive.
This is meant to prepare the transition of the default language level from
currently Py2 to Py3, since that is what most new users will expect these days.
The future default will, however, not enforce unicode literals, because this
has proven a major obstacle in the support for both Python 2.x and 3.x.  The
next major release is intended to make this change, so that it will parse all
code that does not request a specific language level as Python 3 code, but with
<code><span>str</span></code> literals.  The language level 2 will continue to be supported for an
indefinite time.</p></li>
<li><p>The documentation was restructured, cleaned up and examples are now tested.
The NumPy tutorial was also rewritten to simplify the running example.

<li><p>Cython compiles less of its own modules at build time to reduce the installed
package size to about half of its previous size.  This makes the compiler
slightly slower, by about 5-7%.</p></li>

<h3>Features added<a href="#id194" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Extension module initialisation follows
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0489/">PEP 489</a> in CPython 3.5+, which
resolves several differences with regard to normal Python modules.  This makes
the global names <code><span>__file__</span></code> and <code><span>__path__</span></code> correctly available to module
level code and improves the support for module-level relative imports.
(Github issues <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1715">#1715</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1753">#1753</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1035">#1035</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Asynchronous generators (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0525/">PEP 525</a>)
and asynchronous comprehensions (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0530/">PEP 530</a>)
have been implemented.  Note that async generators require finalisation support
in order to allow for asynchronous operations during cleanup, which is only
available in CPython 3.6+.  All other functionality has been backported as usual.</p></li>
<li><p>Variable annotations are now parsed according to
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/">PEP 526</a>.  Cython types (e.g.
<code><span>cython.int</span></code>) are evaluated as C type declarations and everything else as Python
types.  This can be disabled with the directive <code><span>annotation_typing=False</span></code>.
Note that most complex PEP-484 style annotations are currently ignored.  This will
change in future releases. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1850">#1850</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Extension types (also in pure Python mode) can implement the normal special methods
<code><span>__eq__</span></code>, <code><span>__lt__</span></code> etc. for comparisons instead of the low-level <code><span>__richcmp__</span></code>
method.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/690">#690</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>New decorator <code><span>@cython.exceptval(x=None,</span> <span>check=False)</span></code> that makes the signature
declarations <code><span>except</span> <span>x</span></code>, <code><span>except?</span> <span>x</span></code> and <code><span>except</span> <span>*</span></code> available to pure Python
code.  Original patch by Antonio Cuni.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1653">#1653</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Signature annotations are now included in the signature docstring generated by
the <code><span>embedsignature</span></code> directive.  Patch by Lisandro Dalcin (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1781">#1781</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The gdb support for Python code (<code><span>libpython.py</span></code>) was updated to the latest
version in CPython 3.7 (git rev 5fe59f8).</p></li>
<li><p>The compiler tries to find a usable exception return value for cdef functions
with <code><span>except</span> <span>*</span></code> if the returned type allows it.  Note that this feature is subject
to safety limitations, so it is still better to provide an explicit declaration.</p></li>
<li><p>C functions can be assigned to function pointers with a compatible exception
declaration, not only with exact matches.  A side-effect is that certain compatible
signature overrides are now allowed and some more mismatches of exception signatures
are now detected and rejected as errors that were not detected before.</p></li>
<li><p>The IPython/Jupyter magic integration has a new option <code><span>%%cython</span> <span>--pgo</span></code> for profile
guided optimisation. It compiles the cell with PGO settings for the C compiler,
executes it to generate a runtime profile, and then compiles it again using that
profile for C compiler optimisation.  Currently only tested with gcc.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>len(memoryview)</span></code> can be used in nogil sections to get the size of the
first dimension of a memory view (<code><span>shape[0]</span></code>). (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1733">#1733</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>C++ classes can now contain (properly refcounted) Python objects.</p></li>
<li><p>NumPy dtype subarrays are now accessible through the C-API.
Patch by Gerald Dalley (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/245">#245</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Resolves several issues with PyPy and uses faster async slots in PyPy3.
Patch by Ronan Lamy (Github issues <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1871">#1871</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1878">#1878</a>).</p></li>

<h3>Bugs fixed<a href="#id195" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Extension types that were cimported from other Cython modules could disagree
about the order of fused cdef methods in their call table.  This could lead
to wrong methods being called and potentially also crashes.  The fix required
changes to the ordering of fused methods in the call table, which may break
existing compiled modules that call fused cdef methods across module boundaries,
if these methods were implemented in a different order than they were declared
in the corresponding .pxd file. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1873">#1873</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The exception state handling in generators and coroutines could lead to
exceptions in the caller being lost if an exception was raised and handled
inside of the coroutine when yielding. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1731">#1731</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Loops over <code><span>range(enum)</span></code> were not converted into C for-loops.  Note that it
is still recommended to use an explicit cast to a C integer type in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>Error positions of names (e.g. variables) were incorrectly reported after the
name and not at the beginning of the name.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile time <code><span>DEF</span></code> assignments were evaluated even when they occur inside of
falsy <code><span>IF</span></code> blocks. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1796">#1796</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Disabling the line tracing from a trace function could fail.
Original patch by Dmitry Trofimov. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1769">#1769</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Several issues with the Pythran integration were resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>abs(signed int) now returns a signed rather than unsigned int.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1837">#1837</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Reading <code><span>frame.f_locals</span></code> of a Cython function (e.g. from a debugger or profiler
could modify the module globals. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1836">#1836</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Buffer type mismatches in the NumPy buffer support could leak a reference to the
buffer owner.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the “is_f_contig” and “is_c_contig” memoryview methods together could leave
one of them undeclared. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1872">#1872</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Compilation failed if the for-in-range loop target was not a variable but a more
complex expression, e.g. an item assignment. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1831">#1831</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Compile time evaluations of (partially) constant f-strings could show incorrect
results.</p></li>
<li><p>Escape sequences in raw f-strings (<code><span>fr'...'</span></code>) were resolved instead of passing
them through as expected.</p></li>
<li><p>Some ref-counting issues in buffer error handling have been resolved.</p></li>

<li><p>C++ exceptions raised by overloaded C++ operators were not always
handled.  Patch by Ian Henriksen.</p></li>
<li><p>C string literals were previously always stored as non-const global
variables in the module.  They are now stored as global constants
when possible, and otherwise as non-const C string literals in the
generated code that uses them.  This improves compatibility with
strict C compiler options and prevents non-const strings literals

<li><p>Compile time evaluated <code><span>str</span></code> expressions (<code><span>DEF</span></code>) now behave in a

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/">PEP 492</a>
(async/await) was implemented.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/">PEP 448</a>
(Additional Unpacking Generalizations) was implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for coverage.py 4.0+ can be enabled by adding the plugin
“Cython.Coverage” to the “.coveragerc” config file.</p></li>
<li><p>Annotated HTML source pages can integrate (XML) coverage reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing is supported in <code><span>nogil</span></code> functions/sections and module init code.</p></li>
<li><p>When generators are used in a Cython module and the module imports the
modules “inspect” and/or “asyncio”, Cython enables interoperability by
patching these modules during the import to recognise Cython’s internal
generator and coroutine types. This can be disabled by C compiling the
module with “-D CYTHON_PATCH_ASYNCIO=0” or “-D CYTHON_PATCH_INSPECT=0”</p></li>
<li><p>When generators or coroutines are used in a Cython module, their types
are registered with the <code><span>Generator</span></code> and <code><span>Coroutine</span></code> ABCs in the
<code><span>collections</span></code> or <code><span>collections.abc</span></code> stdlib module at import time to
enable interoperability with code that needs to detect and process Python
generators/coroutines.  These ABCs were added in CPython 3.5 and are
available for older Python versions through the <code><span>backports_abc</span></code> module
on PyPI.  See <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue24018">https://bugs.python.org/issue24018</a></p></li>
<li><p>Adding/subtracting/dividing/modulus and equality comparisons with
constant Python floats and small integers are faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Binary and/or/xor/rshift operations with small constant Python integers
are faster.</p></li>
<li><p>When called on generator expressions, the builtins <code><span>all()</span></code>, <code><span>any()</span></code>,
<code><span>dict()</span></code>, <code><span>list()</span></code>, <code><span>set()</span></code>, <code><span>sorted()</span></code> and <code><span>unicode.join()</span></code>
avoid the generator iteration overhead by inlining a part of their
functionality into the for-loop.</p></li>
<li><p>Keyword argument dicts are no longer copied on function entry when they
are not being used or only passed through to other function calls (e.g.
in wrapper functions).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>PyTypeObject</span></code> declaration in <code><span>cpython.object</span></code> was extended.</p></li>
<li><p>The builtin <code><span>type</span></code> type is now declared as PyTypeObject in source,
allowing for extern functions taking type parameters to have the correct
C signatures.  Note that this might break code that uses <code><span>type</span></code> just
for passing around Python types in typed variables.  Removing the type
declaration provides a backwards compatible fix.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>wraparound()</span></code> and <code><span>boundscheck()</span></code> are available as no-ops in pure
Python mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Const iterators were added to the provided C++ STL declarations.</p></li>
<li><p>Smart pointers were added to the provided C++ STL declarations.
Patch by Daniel Filonik.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>NULL</span></code> is allowed as default argument when embedding signatures.

<li><p>When compiling with <code><span>--embed</span></code>, the internal module name is changed to
<code><span>__main__</span></code> to allow arbitrary program names, including those that would
be invalid for modules.  Note that this prevents reuse of the generated
C code as an importable module.</p></li>
<li><p>External C++ classes that overload the assignment operator can be used.

<ul>
<li><p>Simple calls to C implemented Python functions/methods are faster.
This also speeds up many operations on builtins that Cython cannot
otherwise optimise.</p></li>
<li><p>The “and”/”or” operators try to avoid unnecessary coercions of their
arguments.  They now evaluate the truth value of each argument
independently and only coerce the final result of the whole expression
to the target type (e.g. the type on the left side of an assignment).
This also avoids reference counting overhead for Python values during

<h3>Bugs fixed<a href="#id248" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Crash when assigning memory views from ternary conditional expressions.</p></li>
<li><p>Nested C++ templates could lead to unseparated “&gt;&gt;” characters being
generated into the C++ declarations, which older C++ compilers could
not parse.</p></li>
<li><p>Sending SIGINT (Ctrl-C) during parallel cythonize() builds could
hang the child processes.</p></li>
<li><p>No longer ignore local setup.cfg files for distutils in pyximport.
Patch by Martin Teichmann.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking a <code><span>char*</span></code> from an indexed Python string generated unsafe
reference counting code.</p></li>
<li><p>Set literals now create all of their items before trying to add them
to the set, following the behaviour in CPython.  This makes a
difference in the rare case that the item creation has side effects
and some items are not hashable (or if hashing them has side effects,
too).</p></li>
<li><p>Cython no longer generates the cross product of C functions for code
that uses memory views of fused types in function signatures (e.g.
<code><span>cdef</span> <span>func(floating[:]</span> <span>a,</span> <span>floating[:]</span> <span>b)</span></code>).  This is considered the
expected behaviour by most users and was previously inconsistent with
other structured types like C arrays.  Code that really wants all type
combinations can create the same fused memoryview type under different
names and use those in the signature to make it clear which types are
independent.</p></li>
<li><p>Names that were unknown at compile time were looked up as builtins at
runtime but not as global module names.  Trying both lookups helps with
globals() manipulation.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed stl container conversion for typedef element types.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>obj.pop(x)</span></code> truncated large C integer values of x to <code><span>Py_ssize_t</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>__init__.pyc</span></code> is recognised as marking a package directory
(in addition to .py, .pyx and .pxd).</p></li>
<li><p>Syntax highlighting in <code><span>cython-mode.el</span></code> for Emacs no longer
incorrectly highlights keywords found as part of longer names.</p></li>
<li><p>Correctly handle <code><span>from</span> <span>cython.submodule</span> <span>cimport</span> <span>name</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix infinite recursion when using super with cpdef methods.</p></li>

<li><p><code><span>yield</span></code> is supported in <code><span>finally</span></code> clauses.</p></li>

<li><p>Constant Python float values are cached.</p></li>
<li><p>String equality comparisons can use faster type specific code in
more cases than before.</p></li>
<li><p>String/Unicode formatting using the ‘%’ operator uses a faster

<li><p><code><span>bytearray</span></code> has become a known type and supports coercion from and
to C strings.  Indexing, slicing and decoding is optimised. Note that
this may have an impact on existing code due to type inference.</p></li>
<li><p>Using <code><span>cdef</span> <span>basestring</span> <span>stringvar</span></code> and function arguments typed as
<code><span>basestring</span></code> is now meaningful and allows assigning exactly
<code><span>str</span></code> and <code><span>unicode</span></code> objects, but no subtypes of these types.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for the <code><span>__debug__</span></code> builtin.</p></li>
<li><p>Assertions in Cython compiled modules are disabled if the running
Python interpreter was started with the “-O” option.</p></li>
<li><p>Some types that Cython provides internally, such as functions and
generators, are now shared across modules if more than one Cython
implemented module is imported.</p></li>
<li><p>The type inference algorithm works more fine granular by taking the
results of the control flow analysis into account.</p></li>
<li><p>A new script in <code><span>bin/cythonize</span></code> provides a command line frontend
to the cythonize() compilation function (including distutils build).</p></li>
<li><p>The new extension type decorator <code><span>@cython.no_gc_clear</span></code> prevents
objects from being cleared during cyclic garbage collection, thus
making sure that object attributes are kept alive until deallocation.</p></li>
<li><p>During cyclic garbage collection, attributes of extension types that
cannot create reference cycles due to their type (e.g. strings) are
no longer considered for traversal or clearing.  This can reduce the
processing overhead when searching for or cleaning up reference cycles.</p></li>

up being instantiated.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>set.add(a_tuple)</span></code> and <code><span>set.discard(a_tuple)</span></code> failed with a

inner classes/functions declared as <code><span>global</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Several corner cases in the try-finally statement were fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>The metaclass of a Python class was not inherited from its parent
class(es).  It is now extracted from the list of base classes if not
provided explicitly using the Py3 <code><span>metaclass</span></code> keyword argument.
In Py2 compilation mode, a <code><span>__metaclass__</span></code> entry in the class
dict will still take precedence if not using Py3 metaclass syntax,
but only <em>after</em> creating the class dict (which may have been done
by a metaclass of a base class, see PEP 3115).  It is generally
recommended to use the explicit Py3 syntax to define metaclasses
for Python types at compile time.</p></li>
<li><p>The automatic C switch statement generation behaves more safely for
heterogeneous value types (e.g. mixing enum and char), allowing for
a slightly wider application and reducing corner cases.  It now always
generates a ‘default’ clause to avoid C compiler warnings about
unmatched enum values.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where class hierarchies declared out-of-order could result
in broken generated code.</p></li>

<li><p>The extension type flag <code><span>Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VERSION_TAG</span></code> is enabled by default

<li><p>EXPERIMENTAL support for simple Cython code level line tracing.  Enabled by
the “linetrace” compiler directive.</p></li>
<li><p>Cython implemented functions make their argument and return type annotations
available through the <code><span>__annotations__</span></code> attribute (PEP 3107).</p></li>
<li><p>Access to non-cdef module globals and Python object attributes is faster.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>Py_UNICODE*</span></code> coerces from and to Python unicode strings.  This is

<h3>Features added<a href="#id290" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Alpha quality support for compiling and running Cython generated extension modules in PyPy (through cpyext). Note that this requires at least PyPy 1.9 and in many cases also adaptations in user code, especially to avoid borrowed references when no owned reference is being held directly in C space (a reference in a Python list or dict is not enough, for example). See the documentation on porting Cython code to PyPy.</p></li>
<li><p>“yield from” is supported (PEP 380) and a couple of minor problems with generators were fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ STL container classes automatically coerce from and to the equivalent Python container types on typed assignments and casts. Note that the data in the containers is copied during this conversion.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ iterators can now be iterated over using “for x in cpp_container” whenever cpp_container has begin() and end() methods returning objects satisfying the iterator pattern (that is, it can be incremented, dereferenced, and compared (for non-equality)).</p></li>
<li><p>cdef classes can now have C++ class members (provided a zero-argument constructor exists)</p></li>
<li><p>A new cpython.array standard cimport file allows to efficiently talk to the stdlib array.array data type in Python 2. Since CPython does not export an official C-API for this module, it receives special casing by the compiler in order to avoid setup overhead on user side. In Python 3, both buffers and memory views on the array type already worked out of the box with earlier versions of Cython due to the native support for the buffer interface in the Py3 array module.</p></li>
<li><p>Fast dict iteration is now enabled optimistically also for untyped variables when the common iteration methods are used.</p></li>
<li><p>The unicode string processing code was adapted for the upcoming CPython 3.3 (PEP 393, new Unicode buffer layout).</p></li>
<li><p>Buffer arguments and memory view arguments in Python functions can be declared “not None” to raise a TypeError on None input.</p></li>
<li><p>c(p)def functions in pure mode can specify their return type with “@cython.returns()”.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic dispatch for fused functions with memoryview arguments</p></li>
<li><p>Support newaxis indexing for memoryviews</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Old-style Py2 imports did not work reliably in Python 3.x and were broken in Python 3.3. Regardless of this fix, it’s generally best to be explicit about relative and global imports in Cython code because old-style imports have a higher overhead. To this end, “from __future__ import absolute_import” is supported in Python/Cython 2.x code now (previous versions of Cython already used it when compiling Python 3 code).</p></li>
<li><p>Stricter constraints on the “inline” and “final” modifiers. If your code does not compile due to this change, chances are these modifiers were previously being ignored by the compiler and can be removed without any performance regression.</p></li>
<li><p>Exceptions are always instantiated while raising them (as in Python), instead of risking to instantiate them in potentially unsafe situations when they need to be handled or otherwise processed.</p></li>
<li><p>locals() properly ignores names that do not have Python compatible types (including automatically inferred types).</p></li>

<li><p>Python classes can now be nested and receive a proper closure at definition time.</p></li>

<li><p>Lambda expressions are supported in class bodies and at the module level.</p></li>

<h3>Other changes<a href="#id312" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Constant tuples are now cached over the lifetime of an extension module, just like CPython does. Constant argument tuples of Python function calls are also cached.</p></li>
<li><p>Closures have tightened to include exactly the names used in the inner functions and classes. Previously, they held the complete locals of the defining function.</p></li>
<li><p>The builtin “next()” function in Python 2.6 and later is now implemented internally and therefore available in all Python versions. This makes it the preferred and portable way of manually advancing an iterator.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to the previously supported inlined generator expressions in 0.13, “sorted(genexpr)” can now be used as well. Typing issues were fixed in “sum(genexpr)” that could lead to invalid C code being generated. Other known issues with inlined generator expressions were also fixed that make upgrading to 0.14 a strong recommendation for code that uses them. Note that general generators and generator expressions continue to be not supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Inplace arithmetic operators now respect the cdivision directive and are supported for complex types.</p></li>
<li><p>Typing a variable as type “complex” previously gave it the Python object type. It now uses the appropriate C/C++ double complex type. A side-effect is that assignments and typed function parameters now accept anything that Python can coerce to a complex, including integers and floats, and not only complex instances.</p></li>
<li><p>Large integer literals pass through the compiler in a safer way. To prevent truncation in C code, non 32-bit literals are turned into Python objects if not used in a C context. This context can either be given by a clear C literal suffix such as “UL” or “LL” (or “L” in Python 3 code), or it can be an assignment to a typed variable or a typed function argument, in which case it is up to the user to take care of a sufficiently large value space of the target.</p></li>
<li><p>Python functions are declared in the order they appear in the file, rather than all being created at module creation time. This is consistent with Python and needed to support, for example, conditional or repeated declarations of functions. In the face of circular imports this may cause code to break, so a new –disable-function-redefinition flag was added to revert to the old behavior. This flag will be removed in a future release, so should only be used as a stopgap until old code can be fixed.</p></li>

<section id="id314">
<h3>Features added<a href="#id314" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Closures are fully supported for Python functions. Cython supports inner functions and lambda expressions. Generators and generator expressions are not supported in this release.</p></li>
<li><p>Proper C++ support. Cython knows about C++ classes, templates and overloaded function signatures, so that Cython code can interact with them in a straight forward way.</p></li>
<li><p>Type inference is enabled by default for safe C types (e.g. double, bint, C++ classes) and known extension types. This reduces the need for explicit type declarations and can improve the performance of untyped code in some cases. There is also a verbose compile mode for testing the impact on user code.</p></li>
<li><p>Cython’s for-in-loop can iterate over C arrays and sliced pointers. The type of the loop variable will be inferred automatically in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>The Py_UNICODE integer type for Unicode code points is fully supported, including for-loops and ‘in’ tests on unicode strings. It coerces from and to single character unicode strings. Note that untyped for-loop variables will automatically be inferred as Py_UNICODE when iterating over a unicode string. In most cases, this will be much more efficient than yielding sliced string objects, but can also have a negative performance impact when the variable is used in a Python context multiple times, so that it needs to coerce to a unicode string object more than once. If this happens, typing the loop variable as unicode or object will help.</p></li>
<li><p>The built-in functions any(), all(), sum(), list(), set() and dict() are inlined as plain for loops when called on generator expressions. Note that generator expressions are not generally supported apart from this feature. Also, tuple(genexpr) is not currently supported - use tuple([listcomp]) instead.</p></li>
<li><p>More shipped standard library declarations. The python_* and stdlib/stdio .pxd files have been deprecated in favor of clib.* and cpython[.*] and may get removed in a future release.</p></li>
<li><p>Pure Python mode no longer disallows non-Python keywords like ‘cdef’, ‘include’ or ‘cimport’. It also no longer recognises syntax extensions like the for-from loop.</p></li>
<li><p>Parsing has improved for Python 3 syntax in Python code, although not all features are correctly supported. The missing Python 3 features are being worked on for the next release.</p></li>
<li><p>from __future__ import print_function is supported in Python 2.6 and later. Note that there is currently no emulation for earlier Python versions, so code that uses print() with this future import will require at least Python 2.6.</p></li>
<li><p>New compiler directive language_level (valid values: 2 or 3) with corresponding command line options -2 and -3 requests source code compatibility with Python 2.x or Python 3.x respectively. Language level 3 currently enforces unicode literals for unprefixed string literals, enables the print function (requires Python 2.6 or later) and keeps loop variables in list comprehensions from leaking.</p></li>
<li><p>Loop variables in set/dict comprehensions no longer leak into the surrounding scope (following Python 2.7). List comprehensions are unchanged in language level 2.</p></li>

<li><p>The availability of type inference by default means that Cython will also infer the type of pointers on assignments. Previously, code like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>cdef</span> <span>char</span>* <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>untyped_variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>
</pre></div>
<p>would convert the char* to a Python bytes string and assign that. This is no longer the case and no coercion will happen in the example above. The correct way of doing this is through an explicit cast or by typing the target variable, i.e.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>cdef</span> <span>char</span>* <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>untyped_variable1</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>bytes</span><span>&gt;</span><span>s</span>

<span>cdef</span> <span>bytes</span>  <span>bytes_string</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>bool is no longer a valid type name by default. The problem is that it’s not clear whether bool should refer to the Python type or the C++ type, and expecting one and finding the other has already led to several hard-to-find bugs. Both types are available for importing: you can use from cpython cimport bool for the Python bool type, and from libcpp cimport bool for the C++ type. bool is still a valid object by default, so one can still write bool(x).</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>__getsegcount__</span></code> is now correctly typed to take a <code><span>Py_size_t*</span></code> rather than an <code><span>int*</span></code>.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Type inference improvements.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There have been several bug fixes and improvements to the type inferencer.</p></li>
<li><p>Notably, there is now a “safe” mode enabled by setting the infer_types directive to None. (The None here refers to the “default” mode, which will be the default in 0.13.) This safe mode limits inference to Python object types and C doubles, which should speed up execution without affecting any semantics such as integer overflow behavior like infer_types=True might. There is also an infer_types.verbose option which allows one to see what types are inferred.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The boundscheck directive works for lists and tuples as well as buffers.</p></li>
<li><p>len(s) and s.decode(“encoding”) are efficiently supported for char* s.</p></li>
<li><p>Cython’s INLINE macro has been renamed to CYTHON_INLINE to reduce conflict and has better support for the MSVC compiler on Windows. It is no longer clobbered if externally defined.</p></li>
<li><p>Revision history is now omitted from the source package, resulting in a 85% size reduction. Running make repo will download the history and turn the directory into a complete Mercurial working repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Cython modules don’t need to be recompiled when the size of an external type grows. (A warning, rather than an error, is produced.) This should be helpful for binary distributions relying on NumPy.</p></li>

      <section>

      <p>Val is a programming language that leverages <a href="http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2022_02/article2.pdf">mutable value semantics</a> and <a href="https://www.fm2gp.com/">generic programming</a> for high-level systems programming.</p>

<p>Val aims to be:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fast by definition</strong>: Val is compiled ahead-of-time to machine code and relies on its type system to support in-place mutation and avoid unnecessary memory allocations. Val avoids hidden costs such as implicit copies and therefore avoids heavy dependence on an optimizer for basic performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Safe by default</strong>: Val’s foundation of <a href="http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2022_02/article2.pdf">mutable value semantics</a> ensures that ordinary code is memory safe, typesafe, and data-race-free. By explicit, auditable opt-in, programmers can use unsafe constructs for performance where necessary, and can build safe constructs using unsafe ones.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple</strong>: Val borrows heavily from <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift</a> which has demonstrated a user-friendly approach to generic programming and deep support for value semantics. Val’s programming model strengthens and extends this support, while de-emphasizing reference semantics and avoiding the complexities that result from trying to make it statically safe (e.g., memory regions, lifetime annotations, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://tour.val-lang.dev/">language tour</a> gives an overview of Val’s features.
The <a href="https://github.com/val-lang/specification/blob/main/spec.md">language specification</a> and <a href="https://val-4.gitbook.io/val-ir/">IR specification</a> (work in progress) provides detailed information about Val’s syntax and semantics.</p>

<p>Val is under active development and is not ready to be used yet.
The code of the compiler is open source and <a href="https://github.com/val-lang/val">hosted on GitHub</a>.
The current status of the project is described on our <a href="https://www.val-lang.dev/pages/implementation-status.html">roadmap page</a>.</p>

<p>We opened a forum to host <a href="https://github.com/orgs/val-lang/discussions">community discussions</a>.
Please ask questions and/or tell us what you think about the Val project!</p>

<h2 id="sounds-great-but-why-another-language">Sounds great, but why another language?</h2>

<p>Our goals overlap substantially with that of Rust and other commendable efforts, such as <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> or <a href="https://vale.dev/">Vale</a>.
Besides, other programming languages have value semantics (e.g., R or Whiley) and/or provide excellent support for generic programming (e.g., Swift or Haskell).
So why another one?</p>

<p>What sets Val apart in the current landscape is its focus on mutable value semantics for the purpose of writing efficient, generic code.
Val is a zero-cost abstraction language that fully acknowledges the physical constraints of computer architecture.
Yet, it presents a user model that marries these constraints with the benefits of value-oriented programming.</p>

<h2 id="enough-show-me-some-code">Enough, show me some code!</h2>

<p>Okay, okay.
Here’s a simple program:</p>

<pre><code>subscript longer_of(_ a: inout String, _ b: inout String): String {
  if b.count() &gt; a.count() { yield &amp;b } else { yield &amp;a }
}

fun emphasize(_ z: inout String, strength: Int = 1) {
  z.append(repeat_element("!", count: strength)))
}

public fun main() {
  var (x, y) = ("Hi", "World")
  emphasize(&amp;longer_of[&amp;x, &amp;y])
  print("${x} ${y}") // "Hi World!"
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program declares two character strings, appends an exclamation mark to the longest, and prints them both after the mutation.
No pointers or references are used (<code>&amp;</code> in Val does not mean “address of”—it simply marks a mutation), and no unnecessary allocation occurs.
The result of <code>longer_of</code> is a <em>projection</em> of the longer argument, so the mutation of <code>z</code> by <code>emphasize</code> occurs directly on the value of <code>y</code>.  The value is neither copied, nor moved, and yet it is not being passed by reference to <code>emphasize</code>.  The body of <code>emphasize</code> <em>owns</em> <code>z</code> in exactly the same way as it owns <code>strength</code>, which is passed by value: <code>z</code> is an independent value that can only be touched by <code>emphasize</code>.</p>

<p>To better understand, notice that <code>longer_of</code> is not a function; it’s a subscript.
A subscript does not return a value, it <em>projects</em> one, granting the caller temporary read and/or write access to it.</p>

<p>A Python programmer may think that <code>String</code> has reference semantics and that <code>longer_of</code> is simply returning a reference to <code>y</code>.
A C/C++ programmer may think of <code>longer_of</code> as a function that takes and returns pointers or mutable references to values.
Neither of these views are quite right.
All types in Val are value types and their instances behave like ints. 
As a result, the possible accesses to a function parameter are always visible in the body of that function, and can’t be hidden behind some stored reference.</p>

<p>The language guarantees to <code>emphasize</code> that the value of <code>z</code> will not be accessed via <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> (or any other means) until that function returns.</p>

<p>A Rust programmer may think of <code>longer_of</code> as a function that borrows its arguments mutably and returns a mutable reference bound by the lifetime of those arguments.
What happens is semantically identical, but notice that in Val, <code>longer_of</code> has no lifetime annotations.
Lifetime annotations were not elided, they simply do not exist in Val because it uses a simpler model, devoid of references.</p>

<p>Have a look at the section on subscripts in the <a href="https://tour.val-lang.dev/subscripts">language tour</a> to get more information.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elon Musk, Larry Ellison and other current and former members of Tesla's board of directors will return $735 million to settle claims that they massively overpaid themselves, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-directors-settle-lawsuit-over-compensation-735-mln-2023-07-17/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0"><em>Reuters</em></a> has reported. The deal wraps up a saga that started in 2020 stemming from a lawsuit filed by a police and firefighter retirement fund challenging stock options granted to Tesla's board starting in 2017. Directors also agreed not to receive compensation for 2021, 2022 and 2023, and change the way compensation is calculated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tesla's current board includes Elon Musk, his brother Kimbal, Fox News mogul James Murdoch, Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia and former Tesla CTO JB Straubel. The case is separate from a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-hear-final-arguments-trial-over-musks-56-bln-tesla-pay-2023-02-21/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0">lawsuit</a> filed by shareholders against a $56 billion compensation package awarded to CEO Elon Musk.</p>
<p>The Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit accused Tesla's board of giving itself unfair and excessive compensation in the form of 11 million stock options between 2017 and 2020, saying it grossly exceeded norms for a corporate board. The $735 million settlement will be paid back to Tesla in what's called a "derivative lawsuit" — the largest ever awarded by Delaware's Court of Chancerty, according to <em>Reuters</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tesla argued that stock options were used to ensure Director's incentives were aligned with investor goals. Tesla has yet to comment on the affair, but in court documents, said that it agreed to settle to eliminate the risk of future litigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk is fighting a separate lawsuit to defend his $56 billion pay package. It was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/09/23/judge-orders-tesla-board-to-face-trial-with.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0">brought</a> by shareholder Richard Tornette, who claimed that "the largest compensation grant in human history" was given to Musk, even though he didn't focus entirely on Tesla. In 2020, he received the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/teslas-texas-factory-has-produced-its-first-cybertruck-161840934.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0">first of 12 $700 million payments</a> as part of that package.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/18/accessing-llama-2/">https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/18/accessing-llama-2/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36778041">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>




<p>The big news today is <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">Llama 2</a>, the new openly licensed Large Language Model from Meta AI. It’s a really big deal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Llama 2 is available for free for research and commercial use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(swyy <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1681364325469143040">spotted</a> that it was rebranded from LLaMA 2 to Llama 2 <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/commit/6d4c0c290aeec1fa4399694fefb864be5a153bb6">a few hours ago</a>.)</p>
<p>Facebook’s original LLaMA model, released in February, kicked off a seismic wave of innovation in the world of open source LLMs—from fine-tuned variants to from-scratch recreations. I wrote about the impact this was having a few weeks after its original release in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/11/llama/">Large language models are having their Stable Diffusion moment</a>. If anything I under-estimated how significant this was going to be.</p>
<p>There was just one catch: you couldn’t use it for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>That’s changed with Llama 2!</p>
<p>It does still have <a href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/">a couple of interesting limitations</a>, emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will not use the Llama Materials or any output or results of the Llama Materials <strong>to improve any other large language model</strong> (excluding Llama 2 or derivative works thereof).</p>
<p>If, on the Llama 2 version release date, the monthly active users of the products or services made available by or for Licensee, or Licensee’s affiliates, <strong>is greater than 700 million monthly active users</strong> in the preceding calendar month, you must request a license from Meta, which Meta may grant to you in its sole discretion[...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This still makes it available for most commercial purposes. Let’s try it out.</p>
<h4>Accessing Llama 2 using LLM</h4>
<p>My <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool provides command-line access to a wide variety of language models, both via web APIs and self-hosted on your own machine.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/12/llm/">I added plugin support</a> for extending it to support new models. An independently released plugin can now add support for new models to the existing CLI tool.</p>
<p>The brand new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-replicate">llm-replicate</a> plugin provides CLI access to models hosted on <a href="https://replicate.com/">Replicate</a>, and this morning a16z-infra released <a href="https://replicate.com/a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat">a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat</a> which provides Replicate API access to the new Llama 2 13B chat model.</p>
<p>You’ll need a <a href="https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens">Replicate API key</a>.</p>
<p>Install LLM like this:</p>

<p>(I like to use <a href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/">pipx</a>.)</p>
<p>Or if you don’t have <code>pip</code> setup but can use <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:</p>
<div><pre>brew install simonw/llm/llm</pre></div>
<p>Run <code>llm --version</code> to confirm it’s installed.</p>
<p>Next, install the <code>llm-replicate</code> plugin:</p>
<div><pre>llm install llm-replicate</pre></div>
<p>The plugin adds a new <code>llm replicate</code> set of commands—see them with <code>llm --help</code>.</p>
<p>Configure your Replicate API key so the plugin can talk to the API:</p>

<pre><code>Enter key: &lt;paste key here&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Register the new <code>a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat</code> model with the plugin:</p>
<div><pre>llm replicate add a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat \
  --chat --alias llama2</pre></div>
<p>This tells the plugin that it’s a “chat” model, which means you can have continuing conversations with it, rather than just sending single prompts.</p>
<p>Now we can send a prompt, using the <code>llama2</code> alias we configured there:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m llama2 "Ten great names for a pet pelican"
</code></pre>
<p>I get this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certainly! Here are ten great names for a pet pelican:</p>
<ol>
<li>Peanut: A cute and playful name for a small pelican.</li>
<li>Puddles: A fun and silly name for a pelican that loves to splash around in water.</li>
<li>Pete: A classic name that suits a friendly and outgoing pelican.</li>
<li>Penelope: A pretty and elegant name for a female pelican.</li>
<li>Percy: A charming and sophisticated name for a male pelican.</li>
<li>Pippy: A playful and affectionate name for a pelican with a lively personality.</li>
<li>Pelty: A fun and quirky name for a pelican with a unique sense of style.</li>
<li>Pip: A sweet and endearing name for a small pelican.</li>
<li>Plucky: A feisty and adventurous name for a pelican with a big personality.</li>
<li>Poppy: A lovely and delicate name for a female pelican with a sweet disposition.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope these suggestions help you find the perfect name for your pet pelican!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And because it’s a chat model, we can send a follow-up prompt to the <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/usage.html#continuing-a-conversation">same conversation</a>:</p>
<div><pre>llm -c <span><span>"</span>Five more and make them more nautical<span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahoy! Here be five more nautical names for yer pet pelican:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seabird: A fitting name for a pelican that loves the ocean and all its wonders.</li>
<li>Captain Hook: A swashbuckling name for a pelican with a bold and fearless spirit.</li>
<li>Anchor: A sturdy and dependable name for a pelican that’s always grounded and stable.</li>
<li>Finley: A fishy name for a pelican with a love for the sea and all its creatures.</li>
<li>Buoyant: A bouncy and cheerful name for a pelican with a lighthearted and carefree attitude.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope these suggestions float yer boat, matey!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LLM logs every prompt and response sent through it to a SQLite database. I’m using <code>--truncate</code> here to shorten the output to include in this post:</p>

<p>Or run <code>llm logs path</code> to see the path to the SQLite database file. If you have <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> installed you can open the logs database like this:</p>
<pre><code>datasette "$(llm logs path)"
</code></pre>
<p>Or with <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop</a>:</p>
<pre><code>open "$(llm logs path)"
</code></pre>
<h4>What’s next</h4>
<p>I’m really excited about Llama 2. I expect we’ll start seeing all kinds of innovation on top of it as the model weights themselves start to roll out.</p>
<p>I’m particularly looking forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fine-tuned models. Alpaca, Vicuna et-al did amazing things with fine-tuning on top of the original LLaMA. I expect we’ll see dozens of fine-tuned models over the next few weeks.</li>
<li>Implementation of the <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern">reAct</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761">Toolformer</a> patterns, which will enable Llama 2 to drive external tools in a similar way to <a href="https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates">OpenAI Functions</a>. The <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/">Llama 2 paper</a> mentions testing against Toolformer prompts already, so this hopefully won’t be too difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this time we’ll start to see a concerted effort from people to document what kind of prompts work well with Llama 2 for practical purposes, since I expect this model will be an influential piece of the ecosystem for some time to come.</p>

<p>.: Nintendo 64 Test Cart version 1.? :.</p>
<p>Finally, a public release of both complete ROMs from a Nintendo 64 test cart!<br>
Wait, both!?</p>
<p>Test carts were designed to be reprogrammed–in full or in part–through the jtag port or via gangwriter. When there’s any kind of electrical delay whatsoever it seems to map the “testcart_reflash” ROM, allowing you to pipe a new “testcart_runtime” to it. (Check the “reflash interface.txt” doc for more info on how that works.)<br>
That’s rather been the problem up to this point, but it turns out if you stick a bit of polyimide tape over the cart’s CIC pins you can boot to a 64DD while it still maps the main runtime (assuming yours has a CIC+IPL or you programmed your own). Having the code you want exposed means you can just DMA everything instead of trying to read from the exposed flash addresses; there’s a bit of a trick to doing that with 16bit hardware.<br>
This dump was taken via a 64DD dev unit while the runtime was accessible. It was checked against a second dump taken via IO access (doubled-reads, similar to the writing method), and both were compared against an earlier partial dump to verify known good contents. You could also read the individual flash units themselves if your IC programmer supports the chipset / has the right adapter.</p>
<p>Please note that the runtime is not supposed to be some perfect multiple of a chip size. If you have ever had the “privilege” of using jtag you’d understand why. The reflasher is aligned to the start of the last unit (each unit being 0x200000 large) and retains its padding (in other words, the unwritten bytes erased to 0xFF at the end). That file has a maximum size in other words, so that feels like an important thing to preserve.</p>
<p>.: Why version 1.? :.<br>
The specific build is up for debate. It is clearly *not* version 1.0. It’s suspected to be at least a version 1.1–likely final–based on the audio test.<br>
There are two existing blobs of source code for the Go/No Go tool (GnG, used for factory quality control): one from the OMAN archive and another distributed with libultra OS2.0E. Both predate this release (built against OS2.0H). The most noticeable–arguably only–difference from 2.0E is that the left/right audio test stopped using beeps and midi sequences, replacing them with a voice saying “This is your * channel.” It also doesn’t use the “subway” sequence. It’s not clear what version was first used for these standalone cartridges.<br>
(So yes, there’s at least one other version that needs to be tracked down and dumped.)</p>
<p>For those in the know, a partial dump of the main runtime was taken by marshallh back on Jun 29, 2016. That was done by sniffing the address lines and was largely complete, lacking only data that wasn’t accessed (as opposed to used). It’s been available to emulator devs since then, awaiting a complete dump before public release. It’s the same build as this one or very, very close.<br>
It was missing:<br>
*) The tail end of all audio samples. They’re clipped by the player before running to completion so the ends weren’t loaded. (Samples are only loaded on-demand in blocks.) One did have a short non-matching segment, could be a smidgen of corruption or maybe it was leveling or something applied to a single spot.<br>
*) Sequences for noteLeft, noteRight, and subway (plays G, then E). LR were replaced by more explicit “This is your * channel.” messages from version 1.1 onward, but the original beeps &amp; sequences are still compiled in.<br>
*) The number sequence used for the PI test. This is only run (or relevant) when a zaru test rig is attached, not when booted standalone (unless you run it manually via command line).</p>
<p>.: About Zaru :.<br>
Also provided is a short, hopefully accurate, document on how the zaru rig should operate. You could theoretically build one and stick it in a controller slot (like a mempak) to pointlessly check all your grounds. Many of the tests only run with a zaru or run alternate code when one is found.</p>
<p>.: Does It Emulate? :.<br>
If it doesn’t, complain to your emulator’s devs.<br>
There isn’t much point to emulating it other than to confirm accuracy or complaining about the lack of it. The central focus is usually on passing the RCP tests, but you’d be surprised how few emulators support the Recenter button (the Start in L+R+Start toggles 0080, not 1000) or how many neglect the VI entirely, directly outputting the framebuffer (the wiggly triangle video test uses VI settings to clip a window out of the framebuffer and scale it, otherwise you’ll see a triangle bouncing inside a box). Or how many aren’t unicode-aware. (Did they just copy some old PJ64 source or something? Is it that hard to use strncpy(20) and decode instead of hoping a raw bytes “filename” doesn’t throw an error?)</p>
<p>It works fine on flashcarts, but then the test cartridge *is* a flashcart so that’s no surprise. Might be useful if you did a console mod and need to know how bad your solder job really was.</p>
<p>Note it’s *supposed* to display garbage for ~15 seconds, then differently colored garbage about as long before ultimately loading the interface. There’s an initial bootloader in the 80200000 range that first runs some very basic tests–like confirming RDRAM is available &amp; works by running through its setup and some r/w tests–before loading the actual interface code to the 80000000 range, faking a reset (except with zaru where the reset is quite real), then going through the entire initialization routine again and finally setting up some video. Don’t be surprised that it has two sets of basic lib functions. You can sidestep that–and need to if you’re using an iQue–but you’re also avoiding some of the lowest level tests.<br>
It runs some tests a bit differently if 4MB, 6MB, or 8MB of RDRAM are detected. If you don’t think 6MB was ever a thing, try asking around about 64DD support in Ocarina of Time ;*)</p>
<p>The reflasher is relatively pointless to run without a real unit. It was incredibly helpful to learn how to talk to the flash properly and understand the IO limitations; the dumper(s) wouldn’t have been possible without it.</p>

Moreover, the cluster can be <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/admin_guide/cluster_management.html#rebalance-shards-without-downtime">rebalanced</a> based on disk usage, such that large schemas automatically get more resources dedicated to them, while small schemas are efficiently packed together.</p> <p><strong>So far, Citus primarily focused on “row-based sharding”, where tables are hash-distributed across nodes based on the value in the distribution column.</strong> Row-based sharding enables arbitrarily large PostgreSQL tables, with parallel distributed queries, query routing based on filters, and distributed DML and DDL. Row-based sharding is very suitable for analytical applications (e.g. IoT, time series) and other scenarios in which you need very large tables. It also works well for multi-tenant applications that keep their data in a set of shared tables, but to be able to distribute your database effectively you to add a “tenant ID” column to all your tables, and include that column in all filters, inserts, foreign keys, etc. You also need to explicitly run <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/develop/reference_ddl.html#creating-and-distributing-tables">create_distributed_table</a> to select a distribution column for each table. If you skip one of these steps, performance might be poor due to network overhead, or you might run into <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/develop/reference_workarounds.html">distributed SQL limitations</a>.</p> <p><strong>Schema-based sharding has almost no data modelling restrictions or special steps compared to unsharded PostgreSQL.</strong> That makes it easy to build a scalable multi-tenant application with a schema per tenant, or other applications where different parts of your data model can live in different schemas. The main restriction of schema-based sharding is that joins and foreign keys should only involve tables from the same schema (or <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/develop/reference_ddl.html#reference-tables">reference tables</a>), but transactions across schemas still work fine. That makes schema-based sharding much easier to use than row-based sharding, though it only makes sense for specific workload patterns. For applications that can use either model (e.g. multi-tenant apps), a downside of schema-based sharding is the need to manage many tables and performance overhead. A more detailed comparison is given <a href="#choosing-a-sharding-model-for-multi-tenant-saas-apps">below</a>.</p> <h2 id="how-to-use-citus-schema-based-sharding">How to use Citus schema-based sharding for Postgres</h2> <p>You can easily get started with schema-based sharding by enabling the <code>citus.enable_schema_based_sharding</code> setting.

To use schema-based sharding in Citus 12 or later, you create multiple schemas, and use <code>search_path</code> or fully qualified names to switch between schemas when creating tables or running queries.

No additional data modelling steps (like <code>create_distributed_table</code>) required!</p> <p>In a follow up blog post, we’ll dive deeper into different usage scenarios and schema management.</p> <h2 id="benefits-of-schema-based-sharding">Benefits of schema-based sharding in Citus and Postgres</h2> <p>Schema-based sharding gives you an easy path for sharding if your application and database model fits into one of these classes:</p> <p><strong>Multi-tenant applications (schema per tenant)</strong>: Software as a service (SaaS) applications serve many different tenants from a single deployment, often backed by a single database for ease-of-management and cost efficiency. Most queries done by these SaaS applications can be scoped to a single tenant, which makes the tenant a natural shard key. You can shard your Citus database by creating a schema per tenant, as an alternative to distributing tables by a tenant ID column.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.citusdata.com/assets/images/blog/marco-blog-diagram-citus12-fig1.png" width="800" height="380" loading="lazy" alt="schema per tenant app diagram"> <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Schema per tenant application where each tenant has its own schema, typically with the same set of tables</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Microservices (schema per microservice)</strong>: Many cloud-native applications are broken down into microservices that are developed and deployed separately. Each microservice has its own state, which is usually quite small, and simple. Rather than creating and managing a separate database system for each microservice, it is useful to consolidate the state of different microservices into a single distributed database. That way, you have a single place to manage and query all data, can share data and perform transactions across microservices, and can minimize cost by sharing resources, without the database becoming a bottleneck.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.citusdata.com/assets/images/blog/marco-blog-diagram-citus12-fig2.png" width="800" height="380" loading="lazy" alt="schema per microservice app diagram"> <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Schema per microservice application, with each microservice having its state in a separate schema in the same distributed database.</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Vertical partitioning (schema per table group):</strong> The databases of complex OLTP applications often involve many different tables, and not all of them are closely related. “Vertical partitioning” refers to the practice of sharding your database into groups related tables with each group living on its own database server. With schema-based sharding, you can easily achieve this or prepared for it upfront by assigning each group to its own schema and scale out only when necessary (and avoid all the <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figma-scaled-to-multiple-databases/">growing pains</a>).</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.citusdata.com/assets/images/blog/marco-blog-diagram-citus12-fig3.png" width="800" height="380" loading="lazy" alt="vertical partitioning diagram"> <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Vertical partitioning with groups of related tables combined in a schema</figcaption> </figure> <p>Within a distributed schema, you can use arbitrary joins and foreign keys. Transactions that remain scoped to a schema will be efficiently delegated to the node that stores the schema, which minimizes overhead and gives you PostgreSQL performance characteristics at any scale. Distributed transactions across schemas are still possible, with some additional network round trips.</p> <p>Schema-based sharding offers many other benefits over manual, application-level sharding:</p> <ul> <li>Very easy shard management: Just CREATE/DROP SCHEMA, and Citus does the rest.</li> <li><a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/admin_guide/cluster_management.html#rebalance-shards-without-downtime">Automatic rebalancing</a> of schemas across nodes without downtime.</li> <li>Share data across schemas using <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/develop/reference_ddl.html?highlight=reference%20tables#reference-tables">reference tables</a> with support for local joins and foreign keys.</li> <li><a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2023/05/12/tenant-monitoring-in-citus-and-postgres-with-citus-stat-tenants/">Tenant-level statistics</a>, which has been expanded in Citus 12 to treat schemas as tenants.</li> <li>Mixed distributed database modes, e.g. multi-tenancy apps where small tenants live in a shared table and large tenants have their own distributed schema.

One thing to consider is that having a very large number of schemas (or rather, tables) can create certain performance issues in PostgreSQL. For instance, each process keeps a separate catalog cache, which can cause high memory consumption when there are many tables. We recommend carefully considering your sharding model if you expect to have over 10k schemas. Queries and transactions that span multiple schemas may also be slower than on a single PostgreSQL node, and may incur certain <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/develop/reference_workarounds.html">SQL limitations</a>.</p> <h2 id="choosing-a-sharding-model-for-multi-tenant-saas-apps">Choosing a sharding model for multi-tenant SaaS applications</h2> <p>Schema-based sharding is only applicable if your application naturally divides into distinct groups of tables. For applications with a single large table (e.g. IoT measurements), row-based sharding is the obvious choice. However, for multi-tenant applications, row-based sharding (by tenant ID) and schema-based sharding (with a schema per tenant) are both very reasonable options, with different characteristics.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.citusdata.com/assets/images/blog/marco-blog-diagram-citus12-fig4.png" width="800" height="822" loading="lazy" alt="schema-based vs row-based sharding"> <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong>Side-by-side comparison of Schema-based sharding vs. Row-based sharding. In this diagram, the same colors are used on both sides of the diagram to depict data for each of the 5 tenants (green for tenant1, blue for tenant2, yellow for tenant3, grey for tenant4, orange for tenant5)—so you can visually see how the tenant data is distributed in a schema-based sharding model vs. row-based sharding.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Each of these models has different pros and cons to consider:</p> <p><strong>Schema-based sharding</strong>: Each tenant has a separate schema with its own set of tables, in the same database. Tables do not have any restrictions with regards to constraints or foreign keys, except that foreign keys should not cross the schema boundary, unless they are foreign keys to reference tables. Schema-based sharding works especially well to scale applications that have many large tenants but might see performance degradation with a very large number of tenants (&gt;10k).</p> <p><strong>Row-based sharding</strong>: The data from all tenants is in the same set of tables. Each table has a tenant ID column (or equivalent) which acts as the distribution column. Tables are co-located such that the same tenant ID lives on the same node, across different tables. Primary keys, foreign keys, joins, and filter should include the tenant ID column to ensure operations can be evaluated locally. Very large tenants should be <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/v11.3/develop/api_udf.html#isolate-tenant-to-new-shard">isolated to their own shard</a>.</p> <p>A high-level comparison of these sharding models (in the context of multi-tenant applications) is given below:</p> <div> <table><thead> <tr> <th></th> <th><strong>Schema-based sharding</strong></th> <th><strong>Row-based sharding</strong></th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Multi-tenancy model</strong></td> <td>Separate schema per tenant</td> <td>Shared tables with tenant ID columns</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Citus version</strong></td> <td>12.0+</td> <td>All versions</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Additional steps compared to vanilla PostgreSQL</strong></td> <td>None, only a config change</td> <td>Use create_<wbr>distributed_<wbr>table on each table to distribute &amp; co-locate tables by tenant ID</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Number of tenants</strong></td> <td>1-10k</td> <td>100-1M+</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Data modelling requirement</strong></td> <td>No foreign keys across distributed schemas.</td> <td>Need to include a tenant ID column and use it as the a distribution column in each table, and include it in primary keys, foreign keys.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>SQL requirement for single node queries</strong></td> <td>Use a single distributed schema per query.</td> <td>Joins and WHERE clauses should include tenant_id column</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Parallel cross-tenant queries</strong></td> <td>No</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Custom table definitions per tenant</strong></td> <td>Yes</td> <td>No</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Access control</strong></td> <td>Schema permissions</td> <td>Row-level security</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Data sharing across tenants</strong></td> <td>Yes, using reference tables (in a separate schema)</td> <td>Yes, using reference tables</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Tenant to shard isolation</strong></td> <td>Every tenant has its own shard group by definition</td> <td>Can give specific tenant IDs their own shard group via <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/develop/api_udf.html#isolate-tenant-to-new-shard">isolate_<wbr>tenant_<wbr>to_<wbr>new_shard</a></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div> <p>Which model to choose depends on your requirements. The biggest benefit of schema-based sharding is ease-of-use; no additional data modelling steps are required, only a single setting change. If you have a smaller number of large tenants (B2B), and some require a custom table definition or permissions, then schema-based sharding is also a great fit. If you have a very large number of small tenants (B2C) and want to simplify schema management and cross-tenant queries, then row-based sharding is likely to be a better fit.</p> <p>If you need both, then consider that nothing prevents you from using one set of distributed tables for small tenants with row-based sharding, and separate distributed schemas for large tenants.</p> <h2 id="migrating-an-existing-schema-per-tenant-app-to-citus">Migrating an existing schema-per-tenant application to Citus</h2> <p>One more thing… if you already have an existing PostgreSQL application that uses a schema per tenant, then you can easily migrate into a Citus cluster that uses schema-based sharding using <a href="https://github.com/dimitri/pgcopydb">pgcopydb</a>, a powerful open-source database migration tool created by my colleague Dimitri Fontaine.</p> <p>To see it in action, make sure <code>citus.enable_schema_based_sharding = on</code> is in your postgresql.conf and then run:</p> <div><pre><code>pgcopydb clone <span>--source</span> <span>"host=source.host"</span> <span>--target</span> <span>"host=target.host"</span> <span>--restart</span> <span>--drop-if-exists</span> <span>--skip-extensions</span>
</code></pre></div> <p>You can also use the <code>--follow</code> option to replay writes that happen during the migration to avoid downtime. You should not make schema changes or create/drop schemas during the migration. We do recommend extensively testing your application before switching over, and reporting any issues via the <a href="https://github.com/citusdata/citus">Citus GitHub repo</a>.</p> <h2 id="merge-improvements">Extending the MERGE superpower in Citus 12</h2> <p>Schema-based sharding is super exciting and the biggest enhancement in Citus 12, but we also continue to improve Citus for other scenarios, including row-based multi-tenancy and Internet-of-things (IoT) scenarios.</p> <p>PostgreSQL 15 introduced the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-merge.html">MERGE command</a>, which is especially useful when you receive a batch of records and you not only want to insert new records, but also update or delete existing records.</p> <p>For instance, consider the following IoT scenario where we want to maintain a table of “active alerts” based on incoming measurements:</p> <div><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> <span>alerts</span> <span>(</span>

That makes MERGE the most advanced distributed database command available in Citus.</p> <p>If you use MERGE in combination with schema-based sharding, then it will be fully pushed down to the node that stores the schema and handled by PostgreSQL.</p> <h2>Start building scalable apps</h2> <p>Schema-based sharding in Citus 12 gives you a new and easy way to scale out your PostgreSQL database. Whether you are an ISV building a multi-tenant SaaS application, microservices, or a complex OLTP workload that can use vertical partitioning, you can now easily tell Citus how to distribute the database by grouping tables into schemas without any special syntax. There are various application development libraries that will help you do this, but you can also easily build it yourself through simple commands like <code>SET search_path TO &lt;schema name&gt;</code> or using variables schema names in your queries.</p> <p>To learn even more about what Citus 12.0 can do for you:</p> <ul> <li>Check out the <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/updates/v12-0/">12.0 Updates page</a> if you want to read through the detailed release notes</li> <li>Join the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3UPL-EVwKA">Livestream of the Citus 12.0 Release Party, with demos</a>: The livestream will include a demo of schema-based sharding and is happening on Wed 02 Aug @ 9:00am PDT (<a href="https://www.addevent.com/event/oq18048843">mark your calendar</a>.)</li> </ul> <p>And if you want to get started distributing Postgres with Citus, the links in the bullets below should be useful:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/citusdata/citus">Citus open source repo on GitHub</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.citusdata.com/getting-started/">Getting started page for Citus</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.citusdata.com/download/">Download Citus open source</a></li> <li><a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/">Citus open source docs</a></li> <li><a href="https://slack.citusdata.com/">Join the Citus Public Slack</a></li> <li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/postgresql/quickstart-create-portal">Quickstart docs for Citus on Azure</a>, now known as Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL… Since Citus 12.0 is just released, it is not yet available on Azure but it will be soon.

<p dir="auto">Large language models (LLMs) have shown huge success in different text generation tasks and
enable developers to build generative agents based on objectives expressed in natural language.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, most generative agents require heavy customization for specific purposes, and
supporting different use cases can sometimes be overwhelming using existing tools
and frameworks. As a result, it is still very challenging to build a custom generative agent.</p>
<p dir="auto">In addition, evaluating such generative agents, which is usually done by manually trying different scenarios, is a very manual, repetitive, and expensive task.</p>
<p dir="auto">AutoChain takes inspiration from LangChain and AutoGPT and aims to solve
both problems by providing a lightweight and extensible framework
for developers to build their own agents using LLMs with custom tools and
<a href="#workflow-evaluation">automatically evaluating</a> different user scenarios with simulated
conversations. Experienced user of LangChain would find AutoChain is easy to navigate since
they share similar but simpler concepts.</p>
<p dir="auto">The goal is to enable rapid iteration on generative agents, both by simplifying agent customization and evaluation.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does AutoChain simplify building agents?</h2>
<p dir="auto">AutoChain aims to provide a lightweight framework and simplifies the agent building process in a few
ways, as compared to existing frameworks</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Easy prompt update<br>
Engineering and iterating over prompts is a crucial part of building generative
agent. AutoChain makes it very easy to update prompts and visualize prompt
outputs. Run with <code>-v</code> flag to output verbose prompt and outputs in console.</li>
<li>Up to 2 layers of abstraction<br>
As part of enabling rapid iteration, AutoChain chooses to remove most of the
abstraction layers from alternative frameworks</li>
<li>Automated multi-turn evaluation<br>
Evaluation is the most painful and undefined part of building generative agents. Updating the agent to better perform in one scenario often causes regression in other use cases. AutoChain
provides a testing framework to automatically evaluate agent's ability under different
user scenarios.</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example usage</h2>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Workflow Evaluation</h2>
<p dir="auto">It is notoriously hard to evaluate generative agents in LangChain or AutoGPT. An agent's behavior
is nondeterministic and susceptible to small changes to the prompt or model. As such, it is
hard to know what effects an update to the agent will have on all relevant use cases.</p>
<p dir="auto">The current path for
evaluation is running the agent through a large number of preset queries and evaluate the
generated responses. However, that is limited to single turn conversation, general and not
specific to tasks and expensive to verify.</p>
<p dir="auto">To effectively evaluate agents, AutoChain introduces the workflow evaluation framework
which simulates the conversation between a generative agent and simulated users with LLM under
different user contexts and desired outcomes of the conversation. This way, we could add test
cases for different user scenarios and use LLMs to evaluate if multi-turn conversations reached
the desired outcome.</p>
<p dir="auto">To facilitate agent evaluation, AutoChain introduces the workflow evaluation framework. This framework runs conversations between a generative agent and LLM-simulated test users. The test users incorporate various user contexts and desired conversation outcomes, which enables easy addition of test cases for new user scenarios and fast evaluation. The framework leverages LLMs to evaluate whether a given multi-turn conversation has achieved the intended outcome.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to run workflow evaluations</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can either run your tests in interactive mode, or run the full suite of test cases at once.
<code>autochain/workflows_evaluation/conversational_agent_eval /change_shipping_address_test.py</code> contains a few example test cases.</p>
<p dir="auto">To run all the cases defined in a test file:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python autochain/workflows_evaluation/conversational_agent_eval/change_shipping_address_test.py"><pre>python autochain/workflows_evaluation/conversational_agent_eval/change_shipping_address_test.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To run your tests interactively <code>-i</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python autochain/workflows_evaluation/conversational_agent_eval/change_shipping_address_test.py -i"><pre>python autochain/workflows_evaluation/conversational_agent_eval/change_shipping_address_test.py -i</pre></div>

I’ve only ever sold online video courses where you typically start the checkout process and digitally purchase an item within a few seconds or minutes.</p><p>I was helping a friend out recently and worked the counter at a pizza place for a couple of weeks after my normal job. It’s a much different world than doing remote programming and making YouTube videos. I’ll likely make more posts related to this in a programming context but let’s focus on payments in this one.</p><h3 id="placing-an-order-for-pickup">Placing an Order for Pickup</h3><p>Check out this run of the mill workflow that may happen many times a day:</p><ol><li>Customer calls in on the phone to place an order for pickup</li><li>They want to buy a large lightly cooked pie and 6 garlic knots</li><li>You input their order into the POS (point of sale) system</li><li>Each item is listed as a line item with a name, quantity, note and price</li><li>You ask for their name and number and put it into the system</li><li>A total is calculated with sales tax being a separate line item</li><li>The order gets “Created” and the following things happen:<ul><li>The order is placed into “In Progress” with a little icon showing it’s not paid for<ul><li>Being paid or not is independent of the order being in progress</li></ul></li><li>A receipt is printed at the register which is marked “INCOMPLETE”<ul><li>You hang this receipt up so you and others know an order is pending</li></ul></li><li>An order to make 1 pie is printed where the pizza maker can see it</li></ul></li></ol><p>Step 7 is going to be different depending on which POS system you use but the general ideas are the same. There’s the concept of an order being in the system with a status, a human workflow is executed to track that order physically and receipts get printed.</p><p>At no point did we even think about capturing a payment here. For this pickup order there’s a few ways a payment can be collected:</p><ul><li>While on the phone with the customer you enter their credit card details into the system on their behalf, with our above workflow that could have been done after step 6 and then step 7 would be different but let’s put that on hold for now</li><li>They pay for it with either cash or credit when they pick it up</li></ul><p><em>For now we’re also ignoring other types of ways for orders to be input such as them ordering it online and paying for it on the spot or a delivery which could either be paid for and done online or have cash collected upon delivery. More on that later!</em></p><p>Ok so now let’s say the customer comes in 20 minutes from now to pick up their order. At this point you may have accepted 10 other orders from different customers. Some might be in progress and others might be completed. Maybe someone popped in to buy 2 slices to go and was in and out in 3 minutes.</p><p>You check the receipts that are hanging and notice this order is #137, so you go back to the POS system’s “In Progress” tab and find that order. Yep there it is.</p><p>You can see the full total of the order and see if the customer has cash out or a card (or their phone if they’re using Apple / Google Pay). If not, you ask them cash or card and the POS system will let you choose which one.</p><p>If they pick cash, you input the amount they give you and it auto-calculates their change. If they pick card or another digital payment method, they can use the terminal to tap or insert their card / device. It will get authorized and then hopefully be successful unless their card has issues.</p><p>In any case, if the payment is successful then the following happens:</p><ul><li>The order is marked as “Completed” in the system</li><li>Another receipt is printed except with payment information filled in</li><li>You save the receipt if the business owner wants physical receipts saved</li><li>You remove and throw away the hung “INCOMPLETE” receipt so you know it’s done</li></ul><p><em>The pizza maker threw away their print out for that pie independently of the order being completed. From their POV, they are finished when the pie is first placed IN the oven or OUT depending on if the counter workers know how to gauge when a pie is ready to be taken out.</em></p><p>At this point you have a clean slate. The order is complete and it’s been moved through the workflow. Depending on how busy the place is, this might be executed 50 or even 300 times a day with surges coming in around popular lunch and dinner times.</p><p>If you need to go back to an order that’s already been completed you can. You can also print receipts on demand and if there’s been a payment captured you can issue a full or partial refund.</p><p>There’s so much more to go into around payment details but let’s go over a few technical takeaways from the above.</p><h4 id="technical-takeaways">Technical Takeaways</h4><p>Here’s a couple of things I got out of the above and remember thinking about while taking orders and observing the system. If you were building this system out think about the database terms and relationships you might have.</p><p>I’ve quoted the words that could be tables or models.</p><h5 id="an-order-product-and-payment-are-different-things">An “Order”, “Product” and “Payment” are different things</h5><p>An order really pulls together multiple products into something that can be associated as a thing but in my opinion it’s not a join-table between products and payments.</p><p>Order #137 has N products. It also has X payments where X can even be 0 if the order happens to be free, such as if they have a coupon to get 1 free pie after buying 10.</p><p>You would still want that free pie to be put through the workflow and tracked. The only difference is you wouldn’t collect a payment.</p><p>An order has a status to clearly show the stage an order is at. You can almost think of it as a Kanban board that moves from created to completed.</p><h5 id="a-product-has-variants-and-notes">A “Product” has “Variants” and “Notes”</h5><p>At this place a pie can be personal (12”), medium (16”) or large (18”). A customer may want full pepperonis or meatballs. Maybe they want 1/2 and 1/2, or maybe they want 2 full toppings.</p><p>The pie can also have no notes or something specific that the customer wants such as lightly cooked, crispy or well done.</p><p>A variant and note are different things. A variant is something the customer can choose when making the purchase and it may or may not affect the price. Variants are standard things (T-shirt size, etc.) and notes are ADHOC customer requests.</p><p>If enough customers have the same request, maybe that’s a sign you can turn it into a variant but not always. For example, if 90% of people are ok with a normally cooked pizza you may not want to explicitly ask them to choose between regular, light, crispy or well done since it complicates the order process especially if it’s online where they are clicking form fields.</p><p>On the other hand, requiring them to pick large or personal is a good idea since those are different product variants with different prices. However if you were selling shirts you’d likely want colors as a variant even if they don’t adjust the price.</p><h5 id="a-receipt-is-immutable">A “Receipt” is immutable</h5><p>A receipt is created at a specific point in time and it reflects the details at that point in time. It may or may not be printed.</p><p>That’s a very important distinction because even if you didn’t print out orders onto paper you wouldn’t want to modify old orders with different details based on future events.</p><p>For example, if a pie costs $16.95 right now and you have 1,000 orders that happened in the past at that price and then bump your pie to $17.95 you can’t go back and adjust all of those previous orders to have $17.95.</p><p>No way right? The payment was already collected for $16.95 and it’s a done deal.</p><p>That means you shouldn’t have something like a reference to a product’s foreign key to dynamically grab the price when you render the receipt. Just about everything about that receipt should be denormalized, AKA. the details about the receipt are all self contained in that 1 row. It should be an individually rendered thing with its own separate data.</p><h3 id="placing-orders-in-multiple-ways">Placing Orders in Multiple Ways</h3><p>In the above example we handled the use case of a single counter worker entering in an order through the POS system but that’s not the only way orders can be collected.</p><p>If your POS system is integrated with a website or app, customers can place orders online. They still need to come up into your system as “In Progress”. In this case the order isn’t “Completed” yet but the payment was captured.</p><p>Online orders still get receipts hung because the hanging receipt is an indicator to let workers know if a customer received their order. It’s fully independent of a payment being captured or not.</p><p>Additionally, orders can be placed through DoorDash which may or may not even integrate with your POS system. If not, you might get the DoorDash order through a different system but the idea of hanging a receipt while incomplete can still hold true.</p><p>Lastly if we go back to someone taking an order at the pizza shop there could technically be multiple POS systems and multiple terminals to accept credit card payments.</p><p>Each POS system should sync its orders and statuses to each other otherwise you may have conflicting information which will get very confusing. Other than that, it’s the same as our original plan of taking orders at the register. The hanging receipt workflow holds true.</p><h4 id="technical-takeaways-1">Technical Takeaways</h4><p>In the DoorDash case, it’s an interesting idea in that 2 different systems or inputs can still funnel into the same workflow for ensuring an order is fulfilled. In the DoorDash case all orders are already paid for, you’re only keeping track when someone will pick it up. Them picking it up and marking the order as picked up on their phone is the action to complete the order on our end.</p><p>That opens the door for a POS system to integrate with third party order collection systems such as DoorDash. There is a benefit of your POS system being aware of DoorDash so orders get shown in the same place.</p><p>At the place I worked at they were separate. It meant keeping track of 2 different iPad screens and the DoorDash system didn’t even have a printer so we had to write orders out by hand to hang them. Hooking up a receipt printer for DD is a short term TODO item for them.</p><p>The real takeaway here is thinking about separation of concerns, abstractions and the flexibility that’s available when you have decoupled systems. Having DD integration would be a nice quality of live improvement but it’s not a necessity.</p><p>The pizza maker on the back-end doesn’t even need to think about this detail. They just know they have to make a specific type of pizza before X time.</p><h3 id="multiple-payments-per-order">Multiple Payments Per Order</h3><p>Most orders will be either cash or credit on their own but technically someone can pay with both cash and credit. This happened on the first day I was there where someone had a $14 order but they paid with both a gift card and the rest was cash.</p><p>Separate to that you may need to collect additional payments after a transaction has been completed. For example, someone places an order online for a regular pie with a custom note that says “Add buffalo chicken topping”.</p><p>Some folks do this on purpose in hopes to get a $5.50 topping for free. They should have chosen that as a topping through the menu system and it would have been calculated into the total before they paid.</p><p>Others make honest mistakes. Perhaps they’re not used to using online menus and didn’t notice the toppings section or the POS system’s software for online ordering isn’t ideal and didn’t make this noticeable enough.</p><p>In cases like this we’ll go back into the order and then charge an extra $5.50 onto their card. The POS allows you to add $X to an order as long as it’s under a certain amount (I think it’s based on a percent). In almost all cases this can be done without contacting the customer.</p><p>95%+ of the time this is fine and it’s what the customer wants. We always let them know when they pick it up or deliver it that we made the adjustment and it’s on the receipt. They are fully aware of the charge when they receive their food.</p><p>In the very off chance they don’t want the extra charge for the topping they ordered we refund them for just the topping’s charge and either give them a regular pie or let them keep the topping for free. It really depends on the situation.</p><p>Most business owners are ok with making you happy but if you try to take advantage of the situation and do this all the time they will notice and if you continue to abuse the system they may choose not to do business with you anymore.</p><h4 id="technical-takeaways-2">Technical Takeaways</h4><p>A way to describe all of this is an order has many payments. When displaying orders or showing receipts make sure that each payment method has its own line item.</p><h3 id="extra-charges-tips-and-discounts">Extra Charges, Tips and Discounts</h3><p>Besides collecting payments after the initial transaction you may want to add additional charges before a transaction. This is done by clicking an “Extra charge” link near the total and then adding in the amount.</p><p>For example, there’s a $2 delivery charge that gets added to all orders marked as delivery.</p><p>There’s also scenarios where someone may request a custom order that doesn’t have a comparable menu item. Sometimes it makes sense to ring someone up for the closest menu item and then add an extra charge.</p><p>For example, an order of meatballs comes with (2) meatballs and there’s no way to order (1) meatball, so if someone wants (3) meatballs we may ring them up as (2) but then add an extra charge.</p><p>If they have a truly custom order the POS system also has an option to add an ADHOC item with a custom name, quantity and price. This isn’t an extra charge, it’s basically creating a 1 off menu item just for that 1 order.</p><p>Tips are basically extra charges with their own name. It’s important to be able to see “Tip” on the receipt in the expected spot. The credit card terminal allows someone to enter in no tip, a few common percents or a custom amount. There’s also a jar to collect cash tips. I was surprised at how many folks add tips even if they pick the order up themselves.</p><p>There’s also a way to reduce an order’s total with a discount. That’s done by clicking an “Add discount” link. You can choose to apply a fixed amount or percent off discount.</p><p>This may be through the customer having a coupon such as $3 off any pie or maybe the business owner gives a 5% discount on a large bulk order and also waives the delivery fee.</p><h4 id="technical-takeaways-3">Technical Takeaways</h4><p>It’s worth it to support both fixed and percent based discounts. I saw a number of both being applied in a short while and I do the same with courses. In the end a percent based discount applies a fixed amount discount so it’s not too bad to implement.</p><p>It should be easy to create custom items with a name and price for when the situation comes up. If a big order comes in, you don’t want to be struggling to figure out how to do it on the spot. If you’re sure it will happen, IMO it’s worth coding that feature up.</p><p>Likewise with courses, this comes up when organizations want to buy a team license. I ended up creating a custom package for the course for let’s say 25 licenses which goes through the normal checkout process. I have a couple of preset license amounts but I can add a custom amount too.</p><h3 id="voids-and-refunds">Voids and Refunds</h3><p>Once in a while you may create an order that hasn’t received a payment yet and you want to cancel it. This could happen if let’s say you’ve made a menu adjustment on the back-end of the POS system and you want to ensure the price is up to date on the front-end.</p><p>Their specific POS system will auto-create an order as soon as you select any item. Personally I don’t like this but that’s how it is. It makes training more difficult because there’s no training mode and you have to create an order.</p><p>In those cases you can cancel or void the order. It still shows up as an order, except it’s been canceled with no payment. This audit trail is useful to help business owners protect themselves from employees ringing up orders, canceling them and then pocketing the cash.</p><p>Both partial and full refunds can happen on any order that has a payment. Sometimes you may need to refund someone for 1 specific item or the whole order. In our case we can also add a note to the refund so we and the customer know why.</p><p>All of this gets reflected back onto a new receipt that gets printed out.</p><h4 id="technical-takeaways-4">Technical Takeaways</h4><p>Generally speaking when dealing with money having more information is better than less. You want an audit trail covering every event. You should be able to trace through your events to recreate an order backwards and forwards.</p><p>Stripe does a very good job with this if you’ve ever used them before. You usually have multiple events being tied into a specific payment. The time lines all match up and the event data (JSON) is locked in at the time it occurred.</p><h3 id="customers">Customers</h3><p>It’s useful to collect information such as at least the first name of someone who is picking up an order so it can be added to the receipt.</p><p>Having their phone number is handy too in case you need to call them to remind them to pick up their order or if something unexpected happens.</p><p>This is especially important for deliveries. For example, you might be delivering an order to an airport but the airport has 5 different terminals. Maybe the person who took the order over the phone didn’t get the details on where to go.</p><p>In this case the delivery driver can call the customer and arrange where to meet.</p><p>At this place they have a separate caller ID box that gets the name, number and address of the caller. It’s pretty handy. It’s not always correct or available but when it works it saves a good amount of time.</p><p>One thing I learned is it’s hard to hear things when folks have really bad phone habits and the store is busy. Also, trying to get a full address from someone who might be drunk is no easy task! Automating as much of this as possible helps.</p><p>Customer information gets saved too, this way if the same number is input again, the address is auto-filled out. Of course with mobile phones it’s possible that an address can change so we always ask them to confirm their address but again, 95%+ of the time this is a nice time saver.</p><p>Besides that, it helps business owners learn more about who likes what. If you know someone always orders similar pizzas every week then you can ask them “Hi Terry, do you want it lightly cooked like last time?”. This builds a nice rapport.</p><h4 id="technical-takeaways-5">Technical Takeaways</h4><p>Automating data input when possible is good but if it’s important you should always confirm it with another human on the other side. In this case a delivery to the wrong address is a really poor outcome.</p><p>For online orders outside of this pizza place, things like pre-filling a user’s state and zip code from a geo-location service is nice but allow the user to edit this information too. Especially if it’s for shipping an order.</p><h3 id="stripe-shopify-and-square">Stripe, Shopify and Square</h3><p>If you squint hard enough at this post related to “Order”, “Product” and “Customer” objects, this isn’t too different than <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/api" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Shopify</a> and <a href="https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Square’s</a> APIs to accept payments for digital and physical goods.</p><p>Of course, this post only scratches the surface of what to think about. I wrote this post because I was excited about what I learned briefly working at a pizza place. I love thinking about optimizing workflows and self improvement.</p><p>I’m literally the definition of the “will work for pizza” meme but in a good way.</p><p>Seriously though, it really opened my eyes at how important a good user experience is, especially under pressure at a decently busy place. Every action should have a purpose and if there’s spots where you can forget something or you have to think about it, that’s a good opportunity to see how you can refine the workflow to make it seamless.</p><p>Personally if I were building a POS system I’d use their APIs as inspiration or even use one of them directly. Modern day POS systems can end up being basically an iPad mounted onto a register.</p><p>I can’t believe how much I learned about decomposing the problem of “taking orders” just by being in a physical location for a bit and getting into the thick of it. I highly encourage anyone to experience this for a bit at least once in their life.</p><p>So that’s about it in terms of payments. The video below goes into similar detail as this post with a bit more detail and personal asides.</p><h3 id="video">Video</h3><p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YSUxLRlTzZ4??rel=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;controls=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"> </iframe></p><h4 id="timestamps">Timestamps</h4><ul><li>2:06 – Placing an order for pickup</li><li>9:48 – Technical takeaways for picking up an order</li><li>16:02 – Placing orders in multiple ways</li><li>18:31 – Technical takeaways for placing orders in different ways</li><li>20:37 – Multiple payments per order</li><li>25:09 – Voids and refunds</li><li>27:38 – Technical takeaways for refunds</li><li>28:44 – Customers</li><li>31:27 – Technical takeaways about customers</li><li>32:02 – Using Stripe, Shopify and Square’s API as inspiration</li><li>33:38 – Will work for pizza</li></ul><p><strong>What are your payment related takeaways when working at a register?

Some of the worst provisions had been </span><a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/california-adopts-controversial-new-math-framework-heres-whats-in-it/2023/07'" rel="">thankfully watered down</a><span>, but the basic strategy of trying to delay the teaching of subjects like algebra remained. It’s a sign that the so-called “progressive” approach to math education championed by people like Stanford’s Jo Boaler has not yet engendered a critical mass of pushback. </span></p><p><span>And meanwhile, the idea that teaching kids less math will create “equity” has spread far beyond the Golden State. The city of Cambridge, Massachusetts </span><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/07/14/metro/cambridge-schools-divided-over-middle-school-math/" rel="">recently removed algebra</a><span> and all advanced math from its junior high schools, on similar “equity” grounds.</span></p><p><span>It is difficult to find words to describe how bad this idea is without descending into abject rudeness. The idea that offering children fewer educational resources through the public school system will help the poor kids catch up with rich ones, or help the Black kids catch up with the White and Asian ones, is unsupported by any available evidence of which I am aware. More fundamentally, though, it runs counter to </span><em>the whole reason that public schools exist in the first place</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>The idea behind universal public education is that all children — or almost all, making allowance for those with severe learning disabilities — are fundamentally </span><em>educable</em><span>. It is the idea that there is some set of subjects — reading, writing, basic mathematics, etc. — that essentially all children can learn, if sufficient resources are invested in teaching them. </span></p><p><span>Before public education — one of the key crusades of the original Progressive movement — only private actors invested resources in educating children. Families taught their kids skills, rich families hired tutors, companies trained their workers, churches provided some classes, etc. But it was a threadbare, uneven patchwork. Worse, it was highly </span><em>unequal</em><span> — if you weren’t born to a family with lots of time and/or money to spare, you didn’t get nearly as much education. This led to inequality throughout society, as well as the preservation of intergenerational wealth. Furthermore, it wasted much of society’s productive potential, because the unlucky kids weren’t learning as many useful skills as they could have been.</span></p><p><span>Universal public education was a way to attack all of these problems at once. By investing state resources in childhood education, it not only boosted human capital and economic growth, it eroded inequality of birth and circumstance. Teachers, hired by the state, provided some of what poor kids’ families couldn’t provide. Everyone except for a very few fringe ideologues now agrees that this model was a success; public education is pretty much universally believed to be </span><a href="https://gpseducation.oecd.org/revieweducationpolicies/#!node=41761&amp;filter=all" rel="">a key input</a><span> into economic development, and plenty of research supports that notion that it fosters </span><a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/invest-public-education-increase-intergenerational-mobility" rel="">intergenerational mobility</a><span> as well. It is not a perfect equalizer and never will be, but it is one of the more important equalizers that exist in our society. </span></p><p><span>When you ban or discourage the teaching of a subject like algebra in junior high schools, what you are doing is </span><em>withdrawing state resources</em><span> from public education. There is a thing you could be teaching kids how to do, but instead you are refusing to teach it. In what way is refusing to use state resources to teach children an important skill “progressive”? How would this further the goal of equity?</span></p><p>I can easily see one (very twisted) perspective that might lead someone to think it would do so. If you take a strongly “hereditarian” view toward education, then you believe that inborn mental ability — what we typically call “IQ” — determines most of what people can and can’t learn. If you are a strong hereditarian, then perhaps you believe that students who don’t learn algebra well are simply born without the cognitive ability to learn it. </p><p><span>And if you believe </span><em>that</em><span>, then you might conclude that the only way to create equity in society would be to handicap the kids who were born with the ability to learn algebra. Like the Handicapper General in Kurt Vonnegut’s satirical sci-fi short story “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bergeron" rel="">Harrison Bergeron</a><span>”, you might try to kneecap the opportunities of the kids you believed to be the genetic elite. In doing so, you would then become a living, breathing embodiment of this meme that </span><em>opponents</em><span> of equity created in order to ridicule the whole idea:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg" width="960" height="576" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:576,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:181548,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Now, if you went up and asked “progressive” educators like Jo Boaler if they believed in a version of hereditarianism so strong as to make </span><a href="https://twitter.com/charlesmurray/status/1680475688355217411" rel="">Charles Murray himself blush</a><span>, they would undoubtedly deny that they do. And I’m sure they don’t </span><em>consciously</em><span> think that math ability is all in the genes.

But this isn’t just my own anecdote; evidence </span><em>consistently shows</em><span> that tutoring is highly effective. </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27476" rel="">Nickow, Oreopoulos, and Quan (2020)</a><span> surveyed 96 studies using a variety of different tutoring approaches in a variety of different contexts. Here’s </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tutoring-a-time-tested-solution-to-an-unprecedented-pandemic/" rel="">a summary of what they found</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>We found that tutoring is remarkably effective at helping students learn, with over 80% of the 96 included studies reporting statistically significant effects. Averaging results across the studies included in this analysis, we found a pooled effect size of 0.37 standard deviations. In other words, with the help of tutoring, a student at the 50</span><sup>th</sup><span> percentile would improve to the 66</span><sup>th</sup><span> percentile. In the field of K-12 education research where there is little agreement on what works, these findings are remarkable not only for their magnitude but also for their consistency. The evidence is clear that tutoring can reliably help students catch up.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The effectiveness of tutoring can help us understand achievement gaps in math classes. Some students do well because of greater </span><em>preparation</em><span> — they show up already knowing much of the material, or having the general concepts in place to pick it up quickly. This is because they had a tutor at home growing up: </span><em>their parents</em><span>, who had the leisure time and educational background required to teach their kids some math. A few rich parents also hire private tutors, but the main tutors are almost always Mom and Dad.</span></p><p>Now imagine what will happen if we ban kids from learning algebra in public junior high schools. The kids who have the most family resources — the rich kids, the kids with educated parents, etc. — will be able to use those resources to compensate for the retreat of the state. Either their parents will teach them algebra at home, or hire tutors, or even withdraw them to private schools. Meanwhile, the kids without family resources will be out of luck; since the state was the only actor who could have taught them algebra in junior high, there’s now simply no one to teach them. The rich kids will learn algebra and the poor kids will not. </p><p>That will not be an equitable outcome.</p><p>Taken to its logical extreme, the idea of restricting what can be taught in public schools — for whatever reason — leads us back to the pre-public-school era. It leads us to a world of private schools and home schooling. That’s not an era we should seek to return to. Nor am I being hyperbolic; Cambridge’s restriction of junior high algebra is effectively a small step toward that bygone era, since kids with resources will just learn algebra from their parents or be pulled out into private schools.</p><p><span>So what should we do instead? </span><a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/dallas-isds-opt-out-policy-dramatically-boosts-diversity-in-its-honors-classes/" rel="">Dallas came up with an answer</a><span>: Teach kids </span><em>more</em><span> math instead of teaching them less. In 2019, Dallas Independent School District implemented a new equity policy that encouraged many more people to take honors math classes:</span></p><blockquote><p>Many capable Hispanic, Black and English learner students did not elect to join these classes on their own or were passed over by their instructors. And their parents were often unaware they could make the request.&nbsp;</p><p>Dallas ISD, which serves some 142,000 children, took note of the disparity and in 2017 formed a racial equity advisory council — some of whose members had children in the district — with the goal of improving opportunity for all…It decided to move from an opt-in model to an opt-out policy in the 2019-20 school year. Since then…students cannot opt out [of advances classes] without written parent permission. The move has dramatically increased participation among traditionally marginalized children.</p></blockquote><p>The results were pretty incredible. First of all, many more students enrolled in honors math:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0a25-2265-4f8b-891f-6ca4e6693148_1200x720.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0a25-2265-4f8b-891f-6ca4e6693148_1200x720.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0a25-2265-4f8b-891f-6ca4e6693148_1200x720.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0a25-2265-4f8b-891f-6ca4e6693148_1200x720.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0a25-2265-4f8b-891f-6ca4e6693148_1200x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0a25-2265-4f8b-891f-6ca4e6693148_1200x720.jpeg" width="1200" height="720" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/755f0a25-2265-4f8b-891f-6ca4e6693148_1200x720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:123922,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0a25-2265-4f8b-891f-6ca4e6693148_1200x720.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0a25-2265-4f8b-891f-6ca4e6693148_1200x720.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0a25-2265-4f8b-891f-6ca4e6693148_1200x720.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F755f0a25-2265-4f8b-891f-6ca4e6693148_1200x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Source: Dallas Independent School District via </span><a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/dallas-isds-opt-out-policy-dramatically-boosts-diversity-in-its-honors-classes/" rel="">The74</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Before the change, three times as many White students as Black students enrolled in honors math; after the change, it was less than twice as many.

Yes, indeed they did:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>And the policy has not led to a decrease in student scores as some speculated: Last year’s 8</span><sup>th</sup><span>-grade Algebra I students had similar pass rates as those in years prior, the district said, with 95% of Hispanic students passing the test and 76% meeting grade-level proficiency; 91% of Black students passing and 65% meeting grade level and 95% of English learner students passing the state exam and 74% meeting grade level.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Guess what? </span><em>Children are educable</em><span>. If you invest the resources of the state in poor kids and underrepresented minorities, </span><em>they will learn</em><span>. The true path toward equity is to have the state teach </span><em>more</em><span>, not less. Instead of trying to prevent the well-prepared kids from learning algebra, invest more in teaching algebra to the disadvantaged kids!</span></p><p>How did we end up in a world where “progressive” places like California and Cambridge, Massachusetts believe in teaching children less math via the public school system, while a city in Texas believes in and invests in its disadvantaged kids? What combination of performativity, laziness, and tacit disbelief in human potential made the degradation of public education a “progressive” cause célèbre? I cannot answer this question; all I know is that the “teach less math” approach will work against the cause of equity, while also weakening the human capital of the American workforce in the process. </p><p>We created public schools for a reason, and that reason still makes sense. Teach the kids math.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  


  <p>I recently read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178">Impro - Improvisation and the Theatre</a> by Keith Johnstone<sup id="fnref:vgr" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vgr" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It’s a delightful book all about improvisational theatre and importantly <em>how to teach</em> improvisational theatre.</p>

<p>The book inspired me to draw many analogies between the improv actor and the consultant and I have written a five part series. They loosely flow in order but each can be read in any order:</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 1 - The Office is a Theatre for Work</strong>. This post looks at the central problem of “performing” work and how important it is for modern knowledge work - especially for the consultant. We end with some ideas around how to think on your feet without bullshitting.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/">Chapter 2 - Optimism as an Operating System</a></strong>. This post highlights the tendency for consultants to be critical and to see everything as a problem. We’ll reframe this by showing the power of being positive - especially for long-term retainers.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/">Chapter 3 - Blocking &amp; Unblocking Clients</a></strong>. Here we think of clients as blocked actors and we take inspiration from the “Yes! and…” exercise to see how we can unblock clients to generate new strategies and creative thinking with clients.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/06/24/navigating-power-status/">Chapter 4 - Navigating Power &amp; Status</a></strong>. How to get things done inside organizations by understanding power potholes and status switching. We explore the concept of high status and low status and show how the consultant has to become adept at a new skill of “status switching” in order to be successful inside client organizations.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/08/18/the-fool/">Chapter 5 - The Contrary Consultant</a></strong>. Embracing the fool &amp; the power of not fitting in. We explore the identity of outsider and how to reconcile this with working inside client organizations.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1---the-office-is-a-theatre-for-work">Chapter 1 - The Office is a Theatre for Work</h2>

<p>Which of these do you recognize?</p>

<p><em>Working on a detailed presentation only for the meeting to get derailed 5 slides in.</em></p>

<p><em>Ritually showing our face at our desks at the appropriate time to signal that we’re working.</em></p>

<p><em>Attending weekly status meetings to create the performance of keeping things moving.</em></p>

<p><em>Brainstorm sessions to create the illusion of inclusive creativity.</em></p>

<p><em>Workshops with scripted games and exercises and sticky notes to ensure everyone has a good time.</em></p>

<p><em>Jealousy of colleagues who don’t do good work but excel at presenting their work.</em></p>

<p><em>People who talk about their work getting promoted more than those that don’t.</em></p>

<p>Much of modern knowledge work is performance… In fact:</p>

<p><strong>The office is a theatre,  and work is an unfolding narrative on the stage.</strong></p>

<p>Many people aspire to “silent success” at work - to do work that “speaks for itself”. Unfortunately this is the wrong move in the theatre of work. Instead we should aspire to the opposite - <strong>for knowledge work, the performance of the work <em>is</em> the work.</strong></p>

<p>Because in truth - how else could it function?</p>

<p>Much as we might like to think of organizations as rational machines - the reality is that companies are social organizations and people interacting with people is the way decisions are made and how work gets done.</p>

<p>And in this theatre of human work it’s crucial to speak up. Spending time on the performance is not wasted - in fact quite the opposite.</p>

<p>Without performance work gets sidelined, ignored or worse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Among more than 120 evaluation and program executives surveyed at private foundations the US and Canada, more than three-quarters had difficulty commissioning evaluations that result in meaningful insights for the field, their grantees, or the foundation itself, and 70% have found it challenging to incorporate evaluation results into the foundation’s future work. <strong>A survey of over 1600 civil servants in Pakistan and India found that “simply presenting evidence to policymakers doesn’t necessarily improve their decision-making,” with respondents indicating “that they had to make decisions too quickly to consult evidence and that they weren’t rewarded when they did.”</strong> - <a href="https://medium.com/@iandavidmoss/this-is-why-your-hard-work-sits-on-the-shelf-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it-a7ca5e063038">why your hard work sits on the shelf and what to do about it</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in fact <a href="https://twitter.com/round/status/892486242721554433">this excellent Twitter thread from Maxim</a> shows the value in caring deeply about the presentation and context of the work:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nobody ever picks the third, wacky, design direction.</p>— Maxim Leyzerovich (@round) <a href="https://twitter.com/round/status/892486242721554433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2017</a></blockquote>


<p>What does the “performance” of work look like?</p>

<p>Things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Presentations of your work</li>
  <li>Hallway chats</li>
  <li>1:1 conversations to build alignment</li>

<p><strong>In the theatre of work the performance of work is intimately tied to the work itself.</strong></p>

<p>But many employees attempt to hide or ignore the performance of work and the politics of the organization. They imagine that this public sphere of voice and politics is wasted energy or somehow “unfair”<sup id="fnref:unfair" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:unfair" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="being-present-public-and-acting-with-voice">Being present, public and acting with voice</h2>

<p>If we think of the office as a theatre for work the <em>only</em> meaningful way forward is through this sphere of politics and voice. As Venkatesh Rao from Ribbonfarm outlines in his post <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/09/14/how-to-make-history/">how to make history</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You do not appear in public through labor, let alone make history. Laboring humans are fungible as individuals, and only consequential actors with a political voice en masse</strong> (whether organized in egalitarian ways as a working class or non-egalitarian ways as a patriarchy, or ethno-nationalist clientelistic identity group). […]</p>

  <p><strong>If labor is about blending into the processes of nature, and making about interrupting and slowing it to create a durable world, action is about free behaviors that make history.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This ideas of “being public” and “exercising voice” both have relatively specific meanings in the Hannah Arendt sense and I’d encourage you to spend time reading here if you’re not familiar<sup id="fnref:arendt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:arendt" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Here are two examples that might help explain opportunities for being public and having voice:</p>

<p>Example #1: choosing to take a position on something that situates <strong>you</strong> in the company’s world. A great example of this is <a href="https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611">Steve Yegge’s platform rant</a>. Note how closely Steve is situated in the narrative here - it’s not simply an observation of the market but of taking a position on the world that situates Google, Amazon and Steve. This can feel daunting but ask yourself the last time you showed up in Slack to post something that has voice? To say something about the organization…</p>

<p>Example #2: asking questions in public forums (all-hands, quarterly business updates etc). These are opportunities where executives are inviting public voice - they’re asking for people to take positions and have opinions.</p>

<p>Of course there are an infinite number of other situations where voice and being public are possible<sup id="fnref:speech" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:speech" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>… but most employees would rather shy away from these instead of embracing them as part of the work.</p>

<p>Orchestrating performances for your work is the key to more influence and more impact.</p>

<h2 id="enter-stage-left-the-consultant">Enter Stage Left: The Consultant</h2>

<p>Ah, but so far what we’re describing is the reality of the working world. Now let’s situate the consultant in the theatre of work.</p>

<p>The luxury that full time employees gain is the ability to script and rehearse their performances - to plan ahead. The consultant is like an improv actor thrust into a play mid-performance, forced to find ways to fit in, go with the flow and steer the performance all while <em>on stage</em>.</p>

<p>For example - full time employees get the luxury of being involved in 2020 planning. <strong>Consultants are an outcome of 2020 planning</strong> and so get brought in mid-performance to course correct.</p>

<p>Consultants that attempt to halt the performance cause pain and typically don’t stick around. Instead consultants that accept and embrace their nature as improv actors thrive and become integrated into the great performance of the organization.</p>

<h2 id="the-theatre-of-work-is-an-improv-theatre">The Theatre of Work is an Improv Theatre</h2>

<p>As a consultant, attempting to tightly script and design the performance of the work will inevitably lead to <strong>missed timings, missed context or missed feedback</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Missed timings</strong> - As a consultant you’re often working less than 5-days a week with a client. So you’re slower than full-time employees. This means if you try and slow down to polish the performance of your work you can miss the window of opportunity. So the improv consultant must learn to un-polish, prototype and improvise in real-time just to keep up with the client’s organization.</p>

<p><strong>Missed context</strong> - Because you’re not a full-time employee (even if you’re working 5 days a week) you may not be included on all-hands emails, announcements and so on and so you always have to work hard to gain the full context of a client. <strong>Tightly scripting a performance doesn’t leave room for new contexts to emerge during the performance</strong>. Instead there should always be room for new context to emerge and get integrated into the performance in real-time.</p>

<p><strong>Missed feedback</strong> - <strong>It’s not uncommon as a consultant to be the most proficient powerpoint user in the org</strong> (or at least your portion of the org). This has benefits but it also has the unintended consequence of making everything you touch look “finished”. And finished work gets very different feedback from people than raw materials and thinking. So sometimes it’s important to un-design and un-polish your work, to invite people onto the stage to co-create the performance - this way you ensure that you get the appropriate feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Good consultants think of performances more like an unfolding series of improv sessions.</strong></p>

<p>Many organizations at the executive level already function like tight improv groups - reacting to implicit and explicit cues and playing off each other to make in-the-moment decisions.</p>

<p>As a consultant - this executive level improv troupe is where the real work gets done and where you’re aiming for. It’s the essence of why Venkatesh’s idea of client “sparring”<sup id="fnref:sparring" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sparring" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> is so appealing - because it embraces this verbal improv decision making that everyone recognizes.</p>

<p>So how does this idea of improv begin to shape our thinking? Some obvious ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We need to be present in the room. Where the performance of the work <em>is</em> the work we can’t leave the presentation and narrative of the work to others.</li>
  <li>Study the people as much as you study the organization. When you’re reacting to work mid-performance half of what you’re reacting to is the strategy and half of it is the set of relationships and biases of the people in the room.</li>
</ul>

<p>And one non-obvious idea:</p>

<h2 id="the-serendipity-deficit-of-consultants--manufacturing-improv-sessions">The Serendipity-Deficit of Consultants &amp; Manufacturing Improv Sessions</h2>

<p>A failure mode for employees is striving for work to happen in the official channels - to wait for the meeting to talk about the strategy, to wait for the email chain to pitch in. This desire to make work “official” means many employees are uncomfortable talking about their work on the way to the coffee shop or in the hallway between meetings.</p>

<p>But it’s exactly these free-form sessions when executives drop their guard, open up and the possibility to operate in a liminal space between contexts is possible.</p>

<p><strong>And the most important thing to understand about these “spontaneous” improv sessions is that they are most useful for laying the first seed of an idea. Good ideas don’t instantly make an impact and if you want executives to pay attention you have to make sure they hear the idea several times. So drop it first in the hallway before formalizing it in a meeting.</strong></p>

<p>Of course I say “spontaneous” because actually humans are remarkably predictable and it’s often trivial to engineer these serendipitous hallway conversations. And you <em>should</em> be manufacturing them.</p>

<p>Remember - if you’re a consultant in a client’s office two days a week you’re operating at a serendipity-deficit. You simply have less surface area to bump into people. So you have to cheat.</p>

<p>A fellow consultant friend brought up the idea of getting into the office early to deliberately catch the CEO on the way in the door before they settled into focus mode. To intercept them intentionally to create a small improv session. To lay the first seeds for ideas.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-think-on-your-feet-without-bullshitting">How to think on your feet without bullshitting</h2>

<p>Above all else however, you need to embrace a level of “thinking on your feet” - it’s essential to the consultant’s work and a consequence of being brought in mid-performance.</p>

<p>This “thinking on your feet” is about the balance between deflecting decisions for further analysis and providing the answer there and then.</p>

<p>Example: one of the most visible ways this manifests is the first day or week with a new client. Executives love to probe you with “difficult” questions - learning to provide an answer that you believe in but leaves room for revision later is key. The real game that’s being played here is not one of being right or wrong - it’s the executive asking two questions at once - firstly “how much do you know?” and secondly “can you improv?” to understand how useful you’re going to be in the theatre of work.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately -  in the theatre of work there’s a fine line between thinking on your feet and bullshitting…</strong></p>

<p>Who’s been in a meeting and been disgusted with people spouting things that are half-true, made-up or masks over the real truth?</p>

<p>There’s a fine line between reacting to a situation in the room and bullshitting.</p>

<p>As a consultant this is especially hard to avoid. Your default mode of operating is the liminal space between industries, businesses and markets. A few times a year I’m forced to learn something new from scratch. This forces us to work in spaces where we’re often the <em>least</em> knowledgeable about a specific business (even if we are <em>experts</em> in the industry… And sometimes we’re <em>experts</em> at a discipline but neither knowledgeable about the <em>business</em> or the <em>industry</em>).</p>

<p>So here’s a little guide to avoiding bullshit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Immerse yourself in the core business mechanics, you should be able to draw a diagram explaining the core business revenue &amp; profit function reasonably well. The more abstraction here the more you risk a fundamental mis-understanding and straying into BS.</li>
  <li>Become a language chameleon - study and adopt the language,  acronyms and buzzwords of the client’s business. If they call it “earned marketing” you should too. If their CMS is called PinkCloud you call it that too. Specificity allows you to avoid confusion and helps you distinguish between the client’s CMS and the market’s CMS (for example).</li>
  <li>Speak clearly and within your limits. Ask for clarification on points that don’t seem to make sense. No pretending. Don’t adopt the language too quickly! (ha, see how hard this is?)</li>
  <li>Ask stupid questions. Ask questions about company history, about alternative approaches, about failed previous ideas. Just because people at the client choose not to talk about obvious things doesn’t mean you shouldn’t.</li>
  <li>Defend your ideas but not your points. Be willing to defend your ideas even if some data points get challenged. It’s very common that the number or stat you’re using to support your point will be wrong but that the broader idea still holds. Don’t concede the idea but also don’t try and put muscle behind the numbers - accept they’re wrong but keep pressing on the idea to see where you get.</li>
  <li>When you get challenged pull out some counter-factuals - when someone is claiming that your data is wrong challenge them with proving the opposite.</li>
  <li>Keep your eye on the prize for business outcomes, not intellectual debates. Executives are fond of theorizing and debating ideas that stray into the get into the abstract - you can play this game a little but try to be the one to ground conversations in reality.</li>
  <li>Read widely - analogy is the core of cognition. Don’t be afraid to source things from different industries. This is the kind of cross-industry vantage point that clients find hard to get internally.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all ways to avoid bullshitting - but unfortunately there’s one simple way to avoid bullshit - by being critical.</p>

<p><strong>It’s far easier to retreat to the critical, negative position and say why things won’t or can’t work. Except… this is a mistake.</strong></p>

<p>Being positive and optimistic is far harder but more effective. And we’re going to talk about that in the next post…. <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/">Optimism as an Operating System</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.appsmith.com/blog/write-a-great-readme">https://www.appsmith.com/blog/write-a-great-readme</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36773022">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a company, we have aspired to build an amazing open-source community for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.appsmith.com/">Appsmith</a>. To date, Appsmith's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith">Github page</a> has amassed over 28,000 stars and just under 3,000 forks. So what is the key to getting these numbers? It all starts with the all-important README. Your README is the front page for your project — it's often the first impression you make on your users and contributors. An effective README file needs to tell your audience what your project does, how to use it, and how they can help out.</p>
<p>We’ve optimized this by putting the information that’s most useful to the widest audience up front and slowly working our way down to the technical details, by linking to other sources whenever more detail is required to avoid walls of text, and by using visuals wherever possible. In this article, we’ll discuss in more detail how these three principles make a great README file for your project.</p>
<h2 id="principles-of-a-good-readme">Principles of a good README</h2>
<p>There’s no shortage of projects to contribute to on GitHub, which means that it’s easy for potential contributors to overlook projects that aren’t yet very popular, even if they are great projects. This is a tough pill to swallow for many project maintainers who want to believe that their project will succeed just because it is high quality.</p>
<p>In order to make sure your project doesn’t fade into obscurity, it is critical to communicate the value of your project as soon as possible without requiring a ton of effort from potential contributors. The best way to do this is with a clear and concise README that not only has all the important information but looks good and is easy to read. In this article, we recommend a few key principles for accomplishing this and explain how we’ve applied them with the Appsmith README.</p>
<p>When you read something, you start at the top, so start your README file with the most useful information and then gradually work your way down to the technical details. This prevents readers from becoming overwhelmed before they have enough context to understand the inner workings of your project.</p>
<p>It’s also important to recognize what <em>not</em> to include. README files work best when they are succinct and link out to formal documentation whenever in-depth detail is required. The alternative is to have walls of text all over, which can be very off-putting to readers.</p>
<p>We look at the README as the central hub for all the information that users need to understand a project. It should provide a high-level overview of the project and also show users where to go to find more details, including how it works, links to up-to-date installation options, and finally links to detailed information for contributors.</p>
<p>We also think it is beneficial to <em>show</em> instead of <em>tell</em> wherever possible. We recommend using icons, images, and GIFs to keep it visually engaging and provide visual signposts — helping readers quickly navigate to the details that are important to them.</p>
<p>And if a picture is worth a thousand words, a good GIF is worth a million. We’ve found that it’s a good idea to use GIFs whenever an aspect of your project is particularly easy to use, but hard to describe in words. An example of this with our project is showing off how easy it is to build good-looking, functional applications quickly on Appsmith even though there is a massive amount of complexity behind the scenes that is hidden from users.</p>
<p>GIFs and other visuals can never replace the job of documentation for the nitty-gritty details, but they can absolutely provide that extra “wow” factor when showing off the user interface for your project. And they can make it easy for readers to consume a lot of information about your project quickly with little effort, which is the key to increasing adoption and ultimately contribution for your project.</p>
<h2 id="deconstructing-the-appsmith-readme">Deconstructing the Appsmith README</h2>
<p>Let’s go over the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith">Appsmith README</a> in detail and examine each section, why we made it the way it is, and how it uses the principles outlined above to give readers the information they need as painlessly as possible.</p>
<h3 id="the-heading">The heading</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/5mUmwa6DLMq1zy7hYsK5uk/0daa9413bb7815ceb9c286ad6d82d107/readme1.png" alt="readme1" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/blob/release/README.md">Appsmith README</a> begins with our logo, which helps users visually identify our project. Investing in a good logo for your project is more than worth it — brand recognition is critical, even if your project isn’t for-profit. It’s important for your project to look professional and be memorable, so that it's easy to find and doesn’t get supplanted by a better-branded fork.</p>
<p>Next, we introduce Appsmith with a short, two-sentence overview. Here, we focus only on what Appsmith does and who it is for, not how it works; we’ve found that making this section too long can cause readers to quickly lose interest. By this point, readers should have been able to decide whether the project is relevant to their needs or interests at a high level, before we dive into the technical details.</p>
<p>Next, we include some automated stats to give readers an idea of what’s going on in our community. The number of online users from the Discord community, commit stats, and Docker pulls can give users a sense of how many others are also interested in Appsmith. Seeing that our community is active encourages both users and contributors to join the project.</p>
<p>The final ingredients in our README heading are links to Appsmith’s cloud version signup page, our YouTube channel, and templates (a new feature that developers in particular might find very useful). These are the most common “next steps'' for new arrivals, so we make them highly visible.</p>
<p>That’s a total of three examples showing the activity of the project (Discord users, commit activity, Docker pulls) and three calls to action (Get Started, YouTube, Templates) within this first section. This may seem like a lot, but each one calls out to users with a different purpose, and other readers are not negatively impacted by their presence.</p>
<p>We believe that learning how to use the project is the most important information for a user who is interested in the project. However, different users prefer to learn in different ways: some like to read, some like to watch videos, and some like to reference example templates. This is why we’ve added so many different options here to show users how to get up and running with Appsmith.</p>
<p>With the information provided, they can decide whether they’ve found the project that fulfills their requirements, and find the next step they need to take. By using good-looking visuals and links, we’ve packed a lot of information into a very small space without overwhelming the reader.</p>
<h3 id="how-appsmith-works-for-end-users">How Appsmith works (for end users)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/508Eyhk80F99VvYq3GD2fY/8ee9c1f6129d0668e765f6289f90bb28/readme2.png" alt="readme2" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Next, we get into how the software works at a high level. We build on the information from the heading, but give more depth so that users can start to form a mental model of the software to understand its most basic concepts. However at this stage, we still hold back on the in-depth details, which we can elaborate on later.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/7p8YMnJGTTjSxv6QsHkmXr/d2134d6178b3e2dcde73dd3c0ce5947d/readme3.gif" alt="readme3" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Now that the reader has context, we expand on the basic process diagram by showing Appsmith in action using GIFs. Here we’re trying to communicate that building an app with Appsmith is as easy as four simple steps. We’re not trying to teach them the inner workings of the platform yet – that is for later. However, if users are interested in more details at this point, they can follow the included links to the documentation on the Appsmith site.</p>
<h3 id="features-for-end-users">Features (for end users)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/6OhOah9ZpAgu9vjOL9nb3a/82afc43cb85d73ea1bade570791d4640/readme4.png" alt="readme4" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Only now do we get to the information that a lot of READMEs start with: a detailed list of features. At this point, if a reader has read all the way through, they already understand the intentions of the project. Or if a reader is skimming the README, which is more common, it is clear that this is the section geared towards users more familiar with Appsmith who are looking for more details.</p>
<p>Either way, this is the part where we start telling readers more about Appsmith. Text now takes precedence over illustrations so that we can increase the density of information as we explain concepts like our UI builder, pre-built widgets, native database integrations, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/5eEdaQnwdeefFfi8Yvk0Dr/1f9c45230243ef8fdba9d97e71ad7c53/readme5.png" alt="readme5" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Towards the end of the README we start to get into the real technical details. To keep our README skimmable, we do everything we can to avoid walls of text: users should be able to quickly navigate to the major sections, guided by structured, eye-catching formatting.</p>
<p>To assist with this, every feature is bolded with an intuitive icon, with a <span>maximum of one paragraph</span> for the details. We also try to include code snippets wherever it makes sense (for example, when explaining our JavaScript support). And we link out to other resources where it is useful, particularly in sections that include complex topics such as encryption.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-get-set-up-for-end-users">How to get set up (for end users)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/3tikF45pNyhoOoaDeDfNKB/97927fa4f39adf1da754fb023368342d/readme6.png" alt="readme6" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Users reaching this section either have engaged with the previous content and are interested in the project, or have arrived looking for installation instructions and clicked straight through on the appropriate CTA in the heading.</p>
<p>Our installation instructions are succinct and actionable, showing our deployment options and linking to the relevant documentation. We also have many additional deployment options, but we intentionally limit the ones we show here because we believe in recommending only the best to our users and keeping the README skimmable.</p>
<p>This emphasizes that the Appsmith project is <span>easy to set up</span> and has <span>great community support</span>. And of course, we’re still following all of the principles from before: we rely very lightly on text, link out for more details wherever possible, and make sure to include intuitive visuals that are easy on the eyes.</p>
<h3 id="the-contributor-section">The contributor section</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/3xTXrgS39fRjH5vSvhDppy/1136638efc31808b19a48dbb6987c2d7/readme7.png" alt="readme7" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Here’s where we show off our favorite part of Appsmith: the community! We explain our values and how we make sure we maintain a community that people want to be a part of. We then explain more technical information that would benefit contributors, from how to make contributions to how to set up their development environment.</p>
<p>When creating a community around a project, a Code of Conduct can help shape the communication inside the community. We use our Code of Conduct to clearly explain up front what type of community we’re trying to build, as well as which behaviors aren’t acceptable and how enforcement works. This section helps readers tell whether they share Appsmith’s values and whether they should trust that those values will be maintained.</p>
<p>Assuming that they want to be a part of the Appsmith community after reading the Code of Conduct, the next two components show them how. The contribution guide helps new contributors understand how to make an impact while the setup docs show how easy it is to make a contribution. Both of these are designed to cut down the friction to starting, so that potential contributors can jump right in.</p>
<p>Another addition that has been great for us is the <em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22">good first issues</a></em> section in GitHub. We feel that it’s important to make it as easy as possible to start contributing to Appsmith. We do this by tagging open issues in GitHub with “Good First Issue,” which is a trend that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.blog/2020-01-22-how-we-built-good-first-issues/">GitHub has encouraged</a> over the last few years. This helps new contributors get early wins, improving the project without having to understand the deep, complicated architecture of a project.</p>
<p>All of these components play an integral part in the contributor section. Each document by itself is short and to the point, so we can communicate what kind of community we’re building and how they can be a part of it without massive walls of text.</p>
<p>We then conclude our README on a high note — with a showcase of our top contributors. We want to show all of the developers who are working to make the Appsmith project great and encourage others to join.</p>
<h3 id="an-often-overlooked-part-of-the-readme--the-license">An often overlooked part of the README — the license</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/2JCA9GrRYrrErCDUf2oAxt/d3733a6c785f6398d7a1c01bee99ea58/readme8.png" alt="readme8" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>As a footnote, we close out our README with a link to the project license. The license should be a separate file stored within your repository and linked at the bottom of the README.</p>
<p>Many people overlook the license as the boring legal component, but the license you choose often has a dramatic impact on your project in the open-source world. Your license can affect the type of users and contributors that you attract, and in some cases the types of derivative projects that exist years after you’ve created yours.</p>
<p>For that reason, it is important to pay special attention to your license up front to make sure that you choose the best one for your project in the short- and long-term. There are plenty of guides out there about how to choose the right license for your project, including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/readme/guides/open-source-licensing">this one from GitHub</a>, so we won’t go too far into the details.</p>
<p>One thing we will say, however, is that we chose the Apache License 2.0 because we wanted to give others the opportunity to build on the work we’ve done (commercially or privately) to drive competition and innovation in the internal tools space.</p>
<h2 id="other-great-readmes">Other great READMEs</h2>
<p>The way we’ve built our README is of course not the only or best way. Each project has different goals and expectations. In order to give some more examples, we also wanted to discuss a couple of different READMEs that we liked across various types of projects.</p>
<h3 id="a-great-package-manager-readme">A great package manager README</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/1uRYBLcpQmNJfiYWntHVBB/32476c78232daff7d9753edb714a4b23/readme9.png" alt="readme9" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/npm/cli">npm</a> is the most popular package manager for JavaScript. Given that this is a package manager, it is harder to explain the project through visuals. This project does a great job of embracing simplicity in the README itself, keeping things incredibly to-the-point and linking out to the more complicated and detailed information.
<img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/XAt3NtLFHb0Op28IJfLyM/19f2f2780208bd86192f8520ad63c463/readme10.png" alt="readme10" loading="lazy"></p>
<h3 id="a-great-framework-readme">A great framework README</h3>
<p>We also really like the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel">README for Laravel</a>, a popular PHP framework. You can see that they pay attention to a lot of the principles that we focused on in our README, including linking out when more detail is required and avoiding major walls of text.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/WY5cnnjF43tHXmhtrvJee/69bb610152f993b33141ab99b0f18ac4/readme11.png" alt="readme11" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The Laravel README heavily links to the documentation, but, more importantly, it provides links to learning resources for the community. This includes the Laravel Bootcamp to quickly get up and running and Laracasts, a comprehensive video tutorial library. These resources are one of the most appreciated aspects of Laravel according to developers, so it’s important to communicate this to potential users as early as possible (i.e. in the README).</p>
<p>One thing that we did not include in our README, which can be beneficial for emerging open-source projects, is listing how to sponsor the project. Tools like Patreon are a great avenue for developers looking for additional resources to support their project.</p>
<h3 id="a-great-desktop-app-readme">A great desktop app README</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">VSCode</a> is ubiquitous, and it also has a great README.</p>

<p>This README does a lot of things well, including showing what the IDE looks like during use so that users can immediately get an idea of what the product is. This product category is more established and understood by developers than internal tools builders like Appsmith, so more visuals aren’t necessarily required. It has short, to-the-point descriptions of the product with links to more detailed information.</p>
<h3 id="a-great-non-product-readme">A great non-product README</h3>
<p>We also wanted to take a look at an example of a project that’s focused more on education than a product. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning">Homemade Machine Learning</a> from Trekhleb is one such example. Machine learning can get very complex, so a project like this can benefit <span>heavily</span> from good visuals and links. We find that this README does that very well, as it links out to great learning resources about different machine learning techniques.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/29bpsCiVqL2AGIFxq9HGSh/24f200ed074e52a151539c5ab68ac76b/readme13.png" alt="readme13" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>This project makes great use of visuals to help students develop a mental model for the machine learning field, which is quite vast. There are so many different algorithms to learn, but after remembering them, there is a logical way to classify them, which this diagram shows well.</p>

<p>We hope this article has spurred some ideas for your own project. In addition to telling users what your project does, your README sets expectations for quality and ease of use, and is a great way to establish your brand.</p>
<p>We’ve put a lot of thought into the content and structure of our README, and have found that with each iteration we’ve been able to engage more visitors as users and community members by prioritizing the content. We’re all on this development journey, and there’s no one right way…</p>

</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Random splash texts and accurate "x Packages Installed" text!</h2>
<p dir="auto">The <code>update_theme.py</code> script chooses a random line from <code>resources/splashes.txt</code> and generates and replaces the <code>logo.png</code> which holds the splash text, as well as updates the amount of packages currently installed</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Make sure <code>neofetch</code> is installed</li>
<li>Make sure Python 3 (or an equivalent) and the Pillow python package are installed
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Install Pillow either with the python-pillow package from the AUR or with
<code>sudo -H pip3 install pillow</code></li>
<li>It's important to use <code>sudo -H</code>, because it needs to be available for the root user</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To add new splash texts simply edit <code>./resources/splashes.txt</code> and add them to the end of the file (if you add it at the beginning or in the middle, some splashes may never get used because the image cashing uses the line of the file the splash is on)</li>
<li>If you want to remove splashes you should reset the cache by deleting <code>/boot/grub/themes/minegrub-theme/cache</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Update splash and "Packages Installed"...</h3>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">...without systemd</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Just run <code>python /boot/grub/themes/minegrub-theme/update_theme.py</code> (from anywhere) after boot using whatever method works for you</li>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">...with systemd</h4>
<ul dir="auto">

<li>Copy <code>./assets/minegrub-update.service</code> to <code>/etc/systemd/system</code></li>
<li>Enable the service: <code>systemctl enable minegrub-update.service</code></li>
<li>If it's not updating after rebooting (it won't update on the first reboot because it updates after you boot into your system), check systemctl status minegrub-update.service for any errors (for example if pillow isn't installed in the correct scope)</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Adjusting for a different amount of boot options:</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>When you have more/less than 4 boot options, you might want to adjust the height of the bottom bar (that says "Options" and "Console")</li>
<li>The formula and some precalculated values (for 2,3,4,5... boot options) are in the <code>theme.txt</code>, so you should be able to easily change it to the correct value.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Notes:</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>the <code>GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE</code> in the defaults/grub file should be set to <code>menu</code>, so it immediately shows the menu (else you would need to press ESC and you dont want that)</li>
<li>I'm no Linux expert, that's why I explain it so thoroughly, for other newbies :&gt;</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component-type="content-lock" data-load-strategy="exclude">
                                  <p>In 2016, Matt Wansley was trying to get work as a lawyer for a tech company — specifically, working on self-driving cars. He was making the rounds, interviewing at all the companies whose names you know, and eventually found himself talking to an executive at Lyft. So Wansley asked her, straight-out: How committed was Lyft, really, to<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fourth-color-traffic-lights-streets-self-driving-robot-cars-trucks-2023-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""> autonomous driving</a>?</p><p>"Of course we're committed to automated driving," the exec told him. "The numbers don't pencil out any other way."</p><p>Wait a minute, Wansley thought. Unless someone invents a robot that can drive as well as humans, one of America's biggest <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/you-can-request-lyft-as-soon-land-airport-uber-rideshare-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">ride-hailing companies</a> doesn't expect to turn a profit? Like, ever? Something was clearly very, very screwy about the business model of Big Tech.</p>
                          
                          <p>"So what was the investment thesis behind Uber and Lyft?" says Wansley, now a professor at the Cardozo School of Law. "Putting billions of dollars of capital into a money-losing business where the path to profitability wasn't clear?"</p><p>Wansley and a Cardozo colleague, Sam Weinstein, set out to understand the money behind the madness. Progressive economists had long understood that tech companies, backed by gobs of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/early-stage-startups-turn-to-cvcs-as-vc-funding-slows-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">venture capital</a>, were effectively subsidizing the price of their products until users couldn't live without them. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-meta-layoffs-usher-in-era-of-revenue-per-employee-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Think Amazon</a>: Offer stuff cheaper than anyone else, even though you lose money for years, until you scale to unimaginable proportions. Then, once you've crushed the competition and become the only game in town, you can raise prices and make your money back. It's called predatory pricing, and it's supposed to be illegal. It's one of the arguments that progressives in the Justice Department used to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ftc-amazon-antitrust-suit-marketplace-third-party-sellers-lawsuit-bloomberg-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">bust up monopolies</a> like Standard Oil in the early 20th century. Under the rules of capitalism, you aren't allowed to use your size to bully competitors out of the market.</p><p>The problem is, conservative economists at the University of Chicago have spent the past 50 years insisting that under capitalism, predatory pricing is not a thing. Their <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/antlervi4&amp;div=38&amp;id=&amp;page=" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">head-spinning argument</a> goes like this: Predators have a larger market share to begin with, so if they cut prices, they stand to lose much more money than their competitors. Meanwhile their prey can simply flee the market and return later, like protomammals sneaking back to the jungle after the velociraptors leave. Predatory companies could never recoup their losses, which meant predatory behaviors are <em>irrational</em>. And since Chicago School economists are the kind of economists who believe that markets are always rational, that means predatory pricing cannot, by definition, exist.</p><p>The Supreme Court bought the argument. In the 1986 case <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/475/574/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Matsushita Electric Industry Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp<em>.</em></a>, the court famously ruled that "predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried, and even more rarely successful." And in 1993, in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/509/209/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Brooke Group v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</a>, the court said that to convict a company of predatory pricing, prosecutors had to show not only that the accused predators had cut prices below market rates but also that they had a "dangerous probability" of recouping their losses. That effectively shut down the government's ability to prosecute companies for predatory pricing.</p><p>"The last time I checked, no one — including the United States government — has won a predatory pricing case since Brooke Group," says Spencer Waller, an antitrust expert at Loyola's School of Law. "Either they can't prove below-cost pricing, or they can't prove recoupment, because a nonexpert generalist judge who buys the basic theory when they read Matsushita and Brooke Group is super-skeptical this stuff is ever rational, absent really compelling evidence."</p><p>Lots of economists have come up with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-economics-082222-070822" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">solid counter-counterarguments</a> to the Chicago School's skepticism about predatory pricing. But none of them have translated to winnable antitrust cases. Wansley and Weinstein — who, not coincidentally, used to work in antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department — set out to change that. In a new paper titled "<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4437360" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Venture Predation</a>," the two lawyers make a compelling case that the classic model of venture capital — disrupt incumbents, build a scalable platform, move fast, break things — isn't the peak of modern capitalism that Silicon Valley says it is. According to this new thinking, it's <em>anti</em>capitalist. It's illegal. And it should be aggressively prosecuted, to promote free and fair competition in the marketplace.</p><p>"We think real world examples are not hard to find — if you look in the right place," Wansley and Weinstein write. "A new breed of predator is emerging in Silicon Valley." And the mechanism those predators are using to illegally dominate the market is venture capital itself.</p><hr><p>Venture investing is the answer to the question of what would happen if you staffed a bank's loan department with adrenaline junkies. The limited partners in venture funds demand high returns, and those funds are transient things, lasting maybe a decade, which means the clock is ticking. Venture capitalists and the investors who put money into their funds aren't necessarily looking for a successful product (though they wouldn't turn one down). For VCs and their limited partners, the most profitable endgame is a quick exit — either selling off the company or taking it public in an IPO.</p>
                          
                          <p>Those pressures, Wansley and Weinstein argue, encourage risky strategies — including predatory pricing. "If you buy what the Chicago School of economists think about self-funded predators, you might think it's irrational for a company to engage in predatory pricing for a bunch of reasons," Weinstein says. "But it might not be irrational for a VC." The idea that it's so irrational as to be nonexistent is "a bullshit line that has somehow become common wisdom."</p><p>Take Uber, one of their key examples. It'd be one thing if the company had simply outcompeted taxicabs on the merits. Cabs, after all, were themselves a fat and complacent monopoly. "Matt and I don't have any problem with that," Weinstein says. "You have a new product, scale quickly, and use some subsidies to get people on board." Disrupt an old business and make a new one.</p><p>But that's not what happened. As in a soap opera or a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wandavision-marvel-dc-star-wars-multiverse-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">comic-book multiverse</a>, the ending never arrived. Uber kept subsidizing riders and drivers, losing billions trying to spend its competitors into oblivion. The same goes for a lot of other VC-backed companies. "WeWork was setting up offices right next to other coworking spaces and saying, 'We'll give you 12 months free.' Bird was scattering its scooters all over cities," Wansley says. "The pattern to us just seems very familiar."&nbsp;</p><blockquote><q>Uber is one of the best investments in history, and it was a predatory pricing.</q></blockquote><p>On its face, it also seems to prove the point of the Chicago School: that companies can never recoup the losses they incur through predatory pricing. Matsushita and Brooke Group require that prosecutors show harm. But if the only outcome of the scaling strategy used by Uber and other VC startups is to create an endless "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/technology/farewell-millennial-lifestyle-subsidy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">millennial lifestyle subsidy</a>," that just means wealth is being transferred from investors to consumers. The only victims of predatory pricing are the predators themselves.</p><p>Where Wansley and Weinstein break important new ground is on the other legal standard set by the Supreme Court: recoupment of losses. If Uber and WeWork and the rest of the unicorns are perpetual money losers, it sounds like the standard isn't met. But Wansley and Weinstein point out that it can be — even if the companies never earn a dime and even if everyone who invests in the companies, post-IPO, loses their bets. That's because the venture capitalists who seeded the company <em>do</em> profit from the predatory pricing. They get in, get a hefty return on their investment, and get out before the whole scheme collapses.</p><p>"Will Uber ever recoup the losses from its sustained predation?" Wansley and Weinstein write. "We do not know. Our point is that, <em>from the perspective of the VCs who funded the predation, it does not matter</em>. All that matters is that investors were willing to buy the VCs' shares at a high price."</p><p>Let's be clear here: This isn't the traditional capitalist story of "you win some, you lose some." The point isn't that venture capitalists sometimes invest in companies that don't make their money back. The point is that the entire model deployed by VCs is to profit by disrupting the marketplace with predatory pricing, and leave the losses to the suckers who buy into the IPO. A company that engages in predatory pricing and its late-stage investors might not recoup, but the venture investors do.&nbsp;</p><p>"The single most important fact in this paper is that Benchmark put $12 million into Uber and got $5.8 billion back," Wansley says. "That's one of the best investments in history, and it was a predatory pricing."</p><hr><p>This new insight — that venture capital is predatory pricing in a new wrapper — could prove transformative. By translating the Silicon Valley jargon of exits and scaling into the legalese of antitrust law, Wansley and Weinstein have opened a door for the prosecution of tech investors and their anticompetitive behavior. "Courts will have to adjust the way they're thinking about recoupment," Weinstein says. "What did the investors who bought from the VCs think was going to happen? Did they think they were going to recoup?" That, he says, would be a "pretty good pathway" for courts to follow in determining whether a company's practices are anticompetitive.</p>
                          
                          <blockquote><q>Capitalism is supposed to allow competition to foster innovation and choice; monopolies quash all that so a few people can get rich.</q></blockquote><p>What makes this argument particularly powerful, from a legal perspective, is that it doesn't reject the basics of the Chicago School's thinking on antitrust. It accepts that consumer welfare and the efficiency of markets are paramount. It just points out that something <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-uncanny-valley" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">uncanny</a> — and illegal — is taking place in Silicon Valley. "I'm pro-enforcement and anti-Chicago School, so I'm always looking for areas where I think they're wrong," Weinstein says. "And here's one."</p><p>That kind of "serious legal scholarship" can be particularly successful with the courts, according to Waller, the antitrust expert at Loyola. "It's a good, modest strategy to say, 'We think your model's wrong, but even if your model's right in general, it's not right here.' That's both how you win cases and how you chip away at an edifice you want to challenge."</p><p>With so many industries imploding into oligopolies — tech, healthcare, pharma, entertainment, journalism, retail — it's a hopeful sign to see the trustbusting mindset stirring to life once more. Capitalism is supposed to allow competition to foster innovation and choice; monopolies quash all that so a few people can get rich. But the new scholarship on predatory pricing could ripple well beyond the courts. Wansley and Weinstein's paper put me in mind of "The Big Con," David Maurer's linguistic study of con artists first published in 1940. Maurer said the most delicate part of a con was the end — the <em>blow-off</em>. After the sucker has been bled dry, the grifter has to ditch the victim, ideally in such a way that they won't go to the cops. In the perfect crime, the mark doesn't even know they've been had. The transfer of lousy tech equity to late-stage investors who have been led to believe it's valuable sure looks like a good blow-off to me.</p><p>So now that we know precisely how Silicon Valley's big con works, maybe the marks won't be so quick to fall for it. Once you know what a phishing email looks like, you tend to stop replying to them. The same goes for recognizing the outlines of this particular grift. "It's not a Ponzi scheme, but it favors certain investors," Weinstein says. "If people in Silicon Valley start thinking about this as a predatory pricing scam, then I think the late-stage investors will start asking questions."</p><p>And not just about ride hailing or office sharing. Maybe grocery delivery? Or streaming-service subscriptions? The same kind of <em>aha! </em>light that went off for Wansley during his interview with the Lyft executive could start to go off for other people as well. Some of them will be investors who decide not to park their money in predatory tech companies. And some of them, perhaps, will be government regulators who are looking for ways to bust our modern-day trusts.</p><hr><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/adam-rogers" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><em>Adam Rogers</em></a> <em>is a senior correspondent at Insider.</em></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  We present a theory for the previously unexplained divergent behavior noticed
in the training of large language models. We argue that the phenomenon is an
artifact of the dominant optimization algorithm used for training, called Adam.
We observe that Adam can enter a state in which the parameter update vector has
a relatively large norm and is essentially uncorrelated with the direction of
descent on the training loss landscape, leading to divergence. This artifact is
more likely to be observed in the training of a deep model with a large batch
size, which is the typical setting of large-scale language model training. To
argue the theory, we present observations from the training runs of the
language models of different scales: 7 billion, 30 billion, 65 billion, and 546
billion parameters.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><article><header><time datetime="2023-07-18T00:00:00Z">Tuesday, July 18, 2023</time></header><section><p>Ten years ago, I wrote <a href="https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/google-go-the-good-the-bad-and-the-meh/">Go: The Good, the Bad, and the Meh</a>. Way back in 2013, it made it to the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5200916">Hacker News</a> and got over 400 comments on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/18b0qb/google_go_the_good_the_bad_and_the_meh/">/r/programming</a>. I don’t have analytics from back then, but I suspect it’s one of my more discussed pieces of writing, and it was definitely one of my first experiences of getting a lot of feedback for my writing. (Then again, I don’t have any evidence of whether <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1293311943995002881">John Carmack read it</a>, so maybe it’s not the one for my obituary.)</p><p>Anyway, it’s been a decade, and in that time I’ve gone from playing around with Go as an amateur to being a professional programmer and using Go as one of my core languages. So, I thought it would be fun to look back at what I got right, what’s changed since I wrote it, what I missed, and what I got wrong. Feel free to read or re-read <a href="https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/google-go-the-good-the-bad-and-the-meh/">the original post</a>, or just stick to my reflections here without digging back into it. Just know that as its title suggests, I wrote it with three sections for what I thought was “good”, “bad”, and “meh” about Go at that time.</p><p>&nbsp;<br><em>Note for anyone submitting this post to social media, the quotation marks in the title are load bearing. <strong>Do not remove them.</strong></em></p><hr><h2 id="what-i-got-right">What I got right</h2><p>I still agree with almost everything I listed in the “good” section from before. All of these things are still good:</p><ul><li>That Go was designed for working on large projects in a team with a modern version control system</li><li>Using capitalization for the public/private distinction in functions, methods, variables, and fields</li><li>Using the directory as the fundamental unit of packaging</li><li>Having a single binary for deployment</li><li>That the go tool is fast and has built in <code>go fmt</code>, <code>go doc</code>, and <code>go test</code></li><li>Using type last style (<code>var x int</code>) rather than type first style (<code>int x</code>)</li><li>Having explicit variable declaration (vs. Python’s implicit declaration by using <code>=</code>)</li><li><a href="https://go.dev/play/">The Go Playground</a></li><li>Logical type names (int64, float32, etc. vs. long and double)</li><li>Having the three basic data types of string, variable length array, and hash map</li><li>Interfaces as compile time duck typing</li><li>Not providing inheritance</li></ul><p>The other sections, well, we’ll come back to them.</p><h2 id="whats-changed">What’s changed</h2><p>The biggest change to Go the language in the last ten years has obviously been the addition of generics.</p><p>In the original post, I listed lack of generics under the “bad” section:</p><blockquote><p>Idiomatic Go code has a couple of different tricks for using interfaces so that you don’t need generics… but sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and copy-and-paste a function three times so you have three differently typed versions of it. If you’re trying to make your own data structure, you can just use <code>interface {}</code> as a universal object type, but then you lose compile time type safety. If you want to make a universal <code>sum</code> function, on the other hand, there’s no really good way to do it.</p></blockquote><p>Generics were added to Go in <a href="https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/2021/golang-118-minor-features/">version 1.18</a> in February 2022. It has basically solved this complaint. A generic <code>sum</code> looks <a href="https://go.dev/play/p/R-QDDqcp3w9">like this</a>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>type</span> <span>Numeric</span> <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>

</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So far, generics have been a change for the better.</p><p>The other major change from the Go of 2013 is the addition of Go modules. I listed the <code>GOPATH</code> system of that time under the “good” section:</p><blockquote><p>[If] you run <code>go get github.com/userA/project/</code> it will use git to download the project from github.com and put it into the right place. Even better, if that project contains the line <code>import "bitbucket.com/userB/library"</code>, the go tool can also download and install <em>that</em> library in the right place. So, in one stroke, Go has its own elegant solution to packaging and a modern, decentralized version of CPAN or PyPI: the VCS you were already using!</p></blockquote><p>Go modules took this existing system and added the ability to specify version requirements for the imported packages and even Go itself. There were some bumps and hurt feelings in the transition from <code>GOPATH</code> to Go modules, but overall, it was very smooth and day-to-day, I can’t say that I’ve run into many problems with them. It just works, and you mostly don’t think about it.</p><p>I said at the time that I was “meh” about the fact that the Go compiler has no warnings, only errors, but the way that this has evolved over the last decade is that warnings with a low false positive rate have become <code>go vet</code> errors, and other warnings just end up in miscellaneous linters. So, it’s still technically true about the compiler that there are no warnings, but the Go ecosystem certainly has lots of avenues for warnings in practice, so it’s only an interesting distinction when you want to complain about Go.</p><h2 id="what-i-missed">What I missed</h2><p>Rereading the post now, what jumps out to me is that there was no mention of unions, sum types, or optional values. I think this just goes to show how much the state of the industry has changed in the last decade. Back then, sum types and optional values were still considered academic features. You saw them in ML derived languages like Haskell, but not in mainstream C-influence languages. Swift wouldn’t come out until 2014, and Rust until 2015, but languages since then have all been judged by whether they have a solution to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer#History">the billion dollar mistake</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don’t think there’s any chance that <code>nil</code> could be removed from Go now. Too much code has been written with it to ever really move on to optional types, at least in Go as we know it. However, there is a proposal to <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57644">add sum types by restricting interface values</a>, and I think that has a good chance of happening in one form or another.</p><p>Again, it shows how things have changed that I praised Go’s type inference as an advance in the state of the art, but now the Hacker News crowd considers Go’s type inference to be very limited compared to other languages. <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/quotes.html">You either die a language nobody uses or live long enough to be one people complain about</a>.</p><p>The other thing that stands out as an omission in the original post in retrospect is that there is no mention of <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">the Go 1 guarantee</a>. When Go 1.0 was released, the Go team promised not to break source compatibility. Of course, there have always been caveats, bugs, and exceptions, but by most reckonings, they have kept their word to a remarkable degree. To be fair to myself, at the time, <a href="https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1">Go 1.0.3 was the current version</a>, so it was impossible for me to know that the Go 1 guarantee would last for a decade plus, but I think that it really was critical in the development of Go into the language it is today. Before Go 1, it was common for the Go team to issue changes to the language or the standard library that needed <code>go fix</code> to be run over a codebase to get it caught up to the new standard. Since then however, if you write a Go program, use the standard library, and don’t rely on unsafe features or security holes, your code should just keep on working indefinitely.</p><p>It’s a real breath of fresh air compared to other ecosystems, and it’s one of my favorite things as a developer. With other languages, upgrading to a new version (<a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/issues/580">even a minor version</a>) is fraught with worry that something, somewhere will break unexpectedly. Even when the breakage is declared in advance with deprecation warnings, it’s still churn that you have to make time to fix as part of the upgrade process. With Go, I just don’t worry about that. Yes, there can be bugs, but nothing is going to break on purpose just because it made life easier for someone else. It feels like the language team is working for me instead of against me.</p><h2 id="what-i-got-wrong">What I got wrong</h2><p>I would say that on the whole, the old post holds up pretty well and nothing in it was egregiously wrong. However, there are a few things where at the time I felt one way, but now I have a slightly more nuanced view without totally disagreeing with myself.</p><p>In the “good” section specifically, there was nothing that was actually bad exactly, but in hindsight, I do see more of the tradeoffs to concurrency.</p><p>I wrote at the time,</p><blockquote><p>It works like you thought concurrency should work before you learned about concurrency. It’s nice. You don’t have to think about it too much. If you want to run a function concurrently, just do <code>go function(arguments)</code>. If you want to communicate with the function, you can use channels, which are synchronous by default, meaning they pause execution until both sides are ready.</p></blockquote><p>This is still true, and I still think working with concurrency in Go is very easy compared to something like Python. (Incidentally, I was writing before <code>Promise</code> and <code>await</code> were added to JavaScript to give context.) On the other hand, nothing in the type system prevents you from creating a data race, so you have to use the race detector religiously in testing, and using channels directly without following <a href="https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/share-memory-by-communicating/">a well known pattern</a> for creating <a href="https://github.com/carlmjohnson/flowmatic">structured concurrency</a> is <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">a surefire recipe for spaghetti code</a>. It’s a tradeoff in that Go gives you just enough rope to hang yourself, but most of the time when you’re just writing a web server or something, you can get most of the benefits of concurrency without the drawbacks.</p><p>On the other hand, most of the things I listed in the “bad” section have mostly been non-problems for me in practice. I’m not sure why I was worried about the string type not having methods. The lack of a <code>#!</code> starting line for scripts turned out <a href="https://github.com/carlmjohnson/go-run">not to matter in practice</a>. That Go isn’t <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> is more of a <em>tradeoff</em> than “bad” per se.</p><p>The lack of generics was an occasional problem, but there were usually pretty obvious workarounds for it, like falling back on dynamic typing, using reflection, or writing a code generator. I’m happy to have generics now, but it’s true that when we didn’t have it, it only occasionally presented a real problem. I am excited to watch how generics impact the future of Go, especially as the Go team work on iterators, but I do worry a bit about “useless uses of generics” where people try to shoehorn in generics where regular interfaces would work just fine. We’ll see how it goes.</p><p>The things I listed in the “meh” section also mostly continue to be tradeoffs, but in retrospect, I think Go took the better side of the tradeoff for the design space it occupies. Not having exceptions is a tradeoff, and while I might wish that Go had something like Zig’s <code>try</code> and <code>errdefer</code>, in practice, it’s fine. Using <code>if err != nil</code> is the worst system except all the other systems that have been tried from time to time, and it turns out to allow <a href="https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/2020/working-with-errors-as/">useful evolutions in user code</a>.</p><p><a href="https://matklad.github.io/">Matklad</a> put it well <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/aocv9o/trouble_with_checked_exceptions_2003#c_bsxqyu">in a recent comment</a>,</p><blockquote><p>It seems we are roughly converging on the error handling. Midori, Go, Rust, Swift, Zig follow similarlish design, which isn’t quite checked exceptions, but is surprisingly close.</p><ul><li>there’s a way to mark functions which can fail. Often, this is a property of the return type, rather than a property of the function (Result in Rust, error pair in Go, <code>!</code> types in Zig, and bare throws decl in Midori and Swift)</li><li>we’ve cranked-up annotation burden and we mark not only throwing function declarations, but call-sites as well (<code>try</code> in Midori, Swift, Zig, <code>?</code> in Rust, <code>if err != nil</code> in Go).</li><li>Default is existentially-typed <code>AnyError</code> (<code>error</code> in Go, <code>Error</code> in Swift, <code>anyhow</code> in Rust, <code>anyerror</code> in Zig). In general, the value is shifted to distinguishing between zero and one error, rather than exhaustively specifying the set of errors.</li></ul></blockquote><p>That seems right to me. Go’s error handling is more verbose than those other languages, but structurally, there’s a lot of commonality under the surface.</p><p>I listed that Go doesn’t have operator overloading, function/method overloading, or keyword arguments as being “meh” features, but I’m pretty happy about them now. The only case where I wish Go had operator overloading is for <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/math/big#Int">big.Int</a>, and I’m hopeful that maybe someday those will be <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19624">added to the language itself</a>. Keyword arguments might be nice to have, but in practice, structs work just fine, and there’s always <a href="https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/2021/requests-golang-http-client/">builders with method chaining</a> for really hairy cases.</p><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p>Before I wrote <a href="https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/google-go-the-good-the-bad-and-the-meh/">the post</a>, I naively thought people would talk about how I had a section that dismissed object oriented programming out of hand. Instead people latched onto my misuse of the word “idiot” to describe people who debate the color of the bikeshed around public/private fields.</p><p>Go’s use of interfaces and lack of inheritance were probably the biggest questions to me when I wrote the article. I thought it was a good idea, but I was prepared to be surprised by experience and run into strong arguments against it. Hynek Schlawack wrote <a href="https://hynek.me/articles/python-subclassing-redux/">a great post in 2021</a> explaining why having interfaces and not having inheritance was a good design choice for Go. Basically, inheritance only makes sense when a subclass is a true specialization of the superclass, in which case Go’s type embedding works fine. So, I got the discussion I wanted, but it took about eight more years.</p><p>It would take until 2019 for Dan Abramov to write <a href="https://overreacted.io/name-it-and-they-will-come/">the definitive explanation of the experience of writing for Hacker News</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Congratulations!</p><p>Your project hit the front page of a popular news aggregator. Somebody visible in the community tweeted about it too. What are they saying?</p><p>Your heart sinks.</p><p>It’s not that people <em>didn’t like</em> the project. You know it has tradeoffs and expected people to talk about them. But that’s not what happened.</p><p><strong>Instead, the comments are largely <em>irrelevant</em> to your idea.</strong></p><p>The top comment thread picks on the coding style in a README example. It turns into an argument about indentation with over a hundred replies and a brief history of how different programming languages approached formatting. There are obligatory mentions of gofmt and Python. Have you tried Prettier?</p></blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote><p><strong>Confused, you close the tab.</strong></p><p>What happened?</p><p>It might be that your idea is simply not as interesting as you thought. That happens. It might also be that you poorly explained it for a casual visitor.</p><p>However, there might be another reason why you didn’t get relevant feedback.</p><p><strong>We tend to discuss things that are easy to talk about.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I’ve come to accept that people on discussion boards (myself included) talk about whatever they were already thinking about when we see the title of a post, and not whatever the article itself proposes. It is what it is, and it’s not going to change any time soon.</p><p>I think Rachel’s <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/05/26/irc/">Run XOR Use rule</a> about running an IRC chat or message board also applies to writing XOR discussing a blog post. If you write the post, you have to be prepared for the discussion to go to something you yourself weren’t even thinking about.</p><p>In terms of Go, I’m about as happy with the language as I’ve ever been. It’s not as fast as Rust, but it already well outpaces my scaling needs, and without too much boilerplate or too much temptation to abstraction. I think the language team has good instincts, and they tend to move at a measured pace in the right direction. I’m excited to see what happens next.</p><p>It’s hard to make predictions, especially about the future. Will I still be using Go in a decade? I don’t know. A decade feels like a longer time in prospect than in retrospect. Maybe we will all just be spot checking the output of code generated by AI by then, <a href="https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/2016-04-09-alphago-and-our-dystopian-ai-future/">as grim as that sounds</a>. But for now at least, I’m happy to use it as my core language.</p><p>Here’s the original conclusion to <a href="https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/google-go-the-good-the-bad-and-the-meh/">the post</a> with my 2023 updates:</p><blockquote><p>Go is rad. <del>It’s not</del> [edit: <ins>It is</ins>] my everyday language (<del>that’s still</del> [edit: <ins>it used to be</ins>] Python), <del>but</del> [edit: <ins>and</ins>] it’s definitely a fun language to use, and one that would be great for doing big projects in. If you’re interested in learning about Go, I recommend <a href="http://tour.golang.org/">doing the tour</a> then <a href="http://golang.org/ref/spec">reading the spec</a> while you put test programs into the <a href="http://play.golang.org/">Playground</a>. The spec is very short and quite readable, so it’s a great way to learn Go.</p></blockquote><p>See you in 2033 for “Ten Years of ‘Ten Years of “Go” ’ ”.</p></section></article></main></div></div>]]></description>

        The Voder was an early attempt at speech synthesis developed by Bell
        Telephone Laboratory for the 1939-40 New York World's Fair. Controlled
        by hand, the operator manually forms each syllable using complex button
        sequences and it would take about a year of practice to able to
        produce fluid speech.
      </p>
      <p>
        Helen Harper was one of the first people to figure out how to operate
        the Voder effectively, and was the live demonstrator at the World's
        Fair. She later went on to form a year-long course instructing women to
        use the Voder. Of 100 applied students, only 20 were able to graduate
        and match Harper's skills.

</figure><p>How many clinical-trial studies in medical journals are fake or fatally flawed? In October 2020, John Carlisle reported a startling estimate<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Carlisle, an anaesthetist who works for England’s National Health Service, is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02241-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02241-z" data-track-category="body text link">renowned for his ability to spot dodgy data in medical trials</a>. He is also an editor at the journal <i>Anaesthesia</i>, and in 2017, he decided to scour all the manuscripts he handled that reported a randomized controlled trial (RCT) — the gold standard of medical research. Over three years, he scrutinized more than 500 studies<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>For more than 150 trials, Carlisle got access to anonymized individual participant data (IPD). By studying the IPD spreadsheets, he judged that 44% of these trials contained at least some flawed data: impossible statistics, incorrect calculations or duplicated numbers or figures, for instance. And 26% of the papers had problems that were so widespread that the trial was impossible to trust, he judged — either because the authors were incompetent, or because they had faked the data.</p><p>Carlisle called these ‘zombie’ trials because they had the semblance of real research, but closer scrutiny showed they were actually hollow shells, masquerading as reliable information. Even he was surprised by their prevalence. “I anticipated maybe one in ten,” he says.</p><p>When Carlisle couldn’t access a trial’s raw data, however, he could study only the aggregated information in the summary tables. Just 1% of these cases were zombies, and 2% had flawed data, he judged (see ‘The prevalence of ‘zombie’ trials’). This finding alarmed him, too: it suggested that, without access to the IPD — which journal editors usually don’t request and reviewers don’t see — even an experienced sleuth cannot spot hidden flaws.</p><figure>

</figure><p>“I think journals should assume that all submitted papers are potentially flawed and editors should review individual patient data before publishing randomised controlled trials,” Carlisle wrote in his report.</p><p>Carlisle rejected every zombie trial, but by now, almost three years later, most have been published in other journals — sometimes with different data to those submitted with the manuscript he had seen. He is writing to journal editors to alert them, but expects that little will be done.</p><p>Do Carlisle’s findings in anaesthesiology extend to other fields? For years, a number of scientists, physicians and data sleuths have argued that fake or unreliable trials are frighteningly widespread. They’ve scoured RCTs in various medical fields, such as women’s health, pain research, anaesthesiology, bone health and COVID-19, and have found dozens or hundreds of trials with seemingly statistically impossible data. Some, on the basis of their personal experiences, say that one-quarter of trials being untrustworthy might be an underestimate. “If you search for all randomized trials on a topic, about a third of the trials will be fabricated,” asserts Ian Roberts, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p><p>The issue is, in part, a subset of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5" data-track-category="body text link">notorious paper-mill problem</a>: over the past decade, journals in many fields have published tens of thousands of suspected fake papers, some of which are thought to have been produced by third-party firms, termed paper mills.</p><p>But faked or unreliable RCTs are a particularly dangerous threat. They not only are about medical interventions, but also can be laundered into respectability by being included in meta-analyses and systematic reviews, which thoroughly comb the literature to assess evidence for clinical treatments. Medical guidelines often cite such assessments, and physicians look to them when deciding how to treat patients.</p><p>Ben Mol, who specializes in obstetrics and gynaecology at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, argues that as many as 20–30% of the RCTs included in systematic reviews in women’s health are suspect.</p><p>Many research-integrity specialists say that the problem exists, but its extent and impact are unclear. Some doubt whether the issue is as bad as the most alarming examples suggest. “We have to recognize that, in the field of high-quality evidence, we increasingly have a lot of noise. There are some good people championing that and producing really scary statistics. But there are also a lot in the academic community who think this is scaremongering,” says Žarko Alfirević, a specialist in fetal and maternal medicine at the University of Liverpool, UK.</p><p>This year, he and others are conducting more studies to assess how bad the problem is. Initial results from a study led by Alfirević are not encouraging.</p><h2><b>Laundering fake trials</b></h2><p>Medical research has always had fraudsters. Roberts, for instance, first came across the issue when he co-authored a 2005 systematic review for the Cochrane Collaboration, a prestigious group whose reviews of medical research evidence are often used to shape clinical practice. The review suggested that high doses of a sugary solution could reduce death after head injury. But Roberts retracted it<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> after doubts arose about three of the key trials cited in the paper, all authored by the same Brazilian neurosurgeon, Julio Cruz. (Roberts never discovered whether the trials were fake, because Cruz died by suicide before investigations began. Cruz’s articles have not been retracted.)</p><p>A more recent example is that of Yoshihiro Sato, a Japanese bone-health researcher. Sato, who died in 2016, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track-category="body text link">fabricated data in dozens of trials of drugs or supplements that might prevent bone fracture</a>. He has 113 retracted papers, according to a list compiled by the website <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/" data-track="click" data-label="https://retractionwatch.com/" data-track-category="body text link">Retraction Watch</a>. His work has had a wide impact: researchers found that 27 of Sato’s retracted RCTs had been cited by 88 systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, some of which had informed Japan’s recommended treatments for osteoporosis<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><p>Some of the findings in about half of these reviews would have changed had Sato’s trials been excluded, says Alison Avenell, a medical researcher at the University of Aberdeen, UK. She, along with medical researchers Andrew Grey, Mark Bolland and Greg Gamble, all at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, have pushed universities to investigate Sato’s work and monitored its influence. “It probably diverted people from being given more effective treatment for fracture prevention,” Avenell says.</p><figure>

</figure><p>The concerns over zombie trials, however, are beyond individual fakers flying under the radar. In some fields, swathes of RCTs from different research groups might be unreliable, researchers worry.</p><p>During the pandemic, for instance, a flurry of RCTs was conducted into whether ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug, could treat COVID-19. But researchers who were not involved have since <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01535-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01535-y" data-track-category="body text link">pointed out data flaws</a> in many of the studies, some of which have been retracted. A 2022 update of a Cochrane review argued that more than 40% of these RCTs were untrustworthy<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>.</p><p>“Untrustworthy work must be removed from systematic reviews,” says Stephanie Weibel, a biologist at the University of Wuerzberg in Germany, who co-authored the review.</p><p>In maternal health — another field seemingly rife with problems — Roberts and Mol have flagged studies into whether a drug called tranexamic acid can stem dangerously heavy bleeding after childbirth. Every year, around 14 million people experience this condition, and some 70,000 die: it is the world’s leading cause of maternal death.</p><p>In 2016, Roberts reviewed evidence for using tranexamic acid to treat serious blood loss after childbirth. He reported that many of the 26 RCTs investigating the drug had serious flaws. Some had identical text, others had data inconsistencies or no records of ethical approval. Some seemed not to have adequately randomized the assignment of their participants to control and treatment groups<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>When he followed up with individual authors to ask for more details and raw data, he generally got no response or was told that records were missing or had been lost because of computer theft. Fortunately, in 2017, a large, high-quality multi-centre trial, which Roberts helped to run, established that the drug was effective<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup>. It’s likely, says Roberts, that in these and other such cases, some of the dubious trials were copycat fraud — researchers saw that a large trial was going on and produced small, substandard copies that no one would question. This kind of fraud isn’t a victimless crime, however. “It results in narrowed confidence intervals such that the results look much more certain than they are. It also has the potential to amplify a wrong result, suggesting that treatments work when they don’t,” he says.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>That might have happened for another question: what if doctors were to inject the drug into everyone undergoing a caesarean, just after they give birth, as a preventative measure? A 2021 review<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup> of 36 RCTs investigating this idea, involving a total of more than 10,000 participants, concluded that this would reduce the risk of heavy blood loss by 60%.</p><p>Yet this April, an enormous US-led RCT with 11,000 people reported only a slight and not statistically significant benefit<sup><a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">8</a></sup>.</p><p>Mol thinks problems with some of the 36 previous RCTs explains the discrepancy. The 2021 meta-analysis had included one multi-centre study in France of more than 4,000 participants, which found a modest 16% reduction in severe blood loss, and another 35 smaller, single-centre studies, mostly conducted in India, Iran, Egypt and China, which collectively estimated a 93% drop. Many of the smaller RCTs were untrustworthy, says Mol, who has dug into some of them in detail.</p><p>It’s unclear whether the untrustworthy studies affected clinical practice. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using tranexamic acid to treat blood loss after childbirth, but it doesn’t have a guideline on preventive administration.</p><h2><b>From four trials to one</b></h2><p>Mol points to a different example in which untrustworthy trials might have influenced clinical practice. In 2018, researchers published a Cochrane review<sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup> on whether giving steroids to people due to undergo caesarean-section births helped to reduce breathing problems in their babies. Steroids are good for a baby’s lungs but can harm the developing brain, says Mol; benefits generally outweigh harms when babies are born prematurely, but the balance is less clear when steroids are used later in pregnancy.</p><p>The authors of the 2018 review, led by Alexandros Sotiriadis, a specialist in maternal–fetal medicine at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece, analysed the evidence for administering steroids to people delivering by caesarean later in pregnancy. They ended up with four RCTs: a British study from 2005 with more than 940 participants, and three Egyptian trials conducted between 2015 and 2018 that added another 3,000 people into the evidence base. The review concluded that the steroids “may” reduce rates of breathing problems; it was cited in more than 200 documents and some clinical guidelines.</p><p>In January 2021, however, Mol and others, who had looked in more depth into the papers, raised concerns about the Egyptian trials. The largest study, with nearly 1,300 participants, was based on the second author’s thesis, he noted — but the trial end dates in the thesis differed from the paper. And the reported ratio of male to female babies was an impossible 40% to 60%. Mol queried the other papers, too, and wrote to the authors, but says he did not get satisfactory replies. (One author told him he’d lost the data when moving house.) Mol’s team also reported statistical issues with some other works by the same authors.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>In December 2021, Sotiriadis’s team updated its review<sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>. But this time, it adopted a new screening protocol. Until that year, Cochrane reviews had aimed to include all relevant RCTs; if researchers spotted potential issues with a trial, using a ‘risk of bias’ checklist, they would downgrade their confidence in its findings, but not remove it from their analysis. But in 2021, Cochrane’s research-integrity team introduced new guidance: authors should try to identify ‘problematic’ or ‘untrustworthy’ trials and exclude them from reviews. Sotiriadis’s group now excluded all but the British research. With only one trial left, there was “insufficient data” to draw firm conclusions about the steroids, the researchers said.</p><p>By last May, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data" data-track="click" data-label="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data" data-track-category="body text link">as Retraction Watch reported</a>, the large Egyptian trial was retracted (to the disagreement of its authors). The journal’s editors wrote in the retraction notice that they had not received its data or a satisfactory response from the authors, adding that “if the data is unreliable, women and babies are being harmed”. The other two trials are still under investigation by publisher Taylor &amp; Francis as part of a larger case of papers, says Sabina Alam, director of publishing ethics at the firm. Before the 2018 review, some clinical guidelines had suggested that administering steroids later in pregnancy could be beneficial, and the practice had been growing in some countries, such as Australia, Mol has reported. The latest updated WHO and regional guidelines, however, recommend against this practice.</p><p>Overall, Mol and his colleagues have alleged problems in more than 800 published medical research papers, at least 500 of which are on RCTs. So far, the work has led to more than 80 retractions and 50 expressions of concern. Mol has focused much of his work on papers from countries in the Middle East, and particularly in Egypt. One researcher responded to some of his e-mails by accusing him of racism. Mol, however, says that it’s simply a fact that he has encountered many suspect statistics and refusals to share data from RCT authors in countries such as Iran, Egypt, Turkey and China — and that he should be able to point that out.</p><h2><b>Screening for trustworthiness</b></h2><p>“Ben Mol has undoubtedly been a pioneer in the field of detecting and fighting data falsification,” says Sotiriadis — but he adds that it is difficult to prove that a paper is falsified. Sotiriadis says he didn’t depend on Mol’s work when his team excluded those trials in its update, and he can’t say whether the trials were corrupt.</p><p>Instead, his group followed a screening protocol designed to check for ‘trustworthiness’. It had been developed by one of Cochrane’s independent specialist groups, the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth (CPC) group, coordinated by Alfirević. (This April, Cochrane formally dissolved this group and some others, as part of a reorganization strategy.) It provides a detailed list of criteria that authors should follow to check the trustworthiness of an RCT — such as whether a trial is prospectively registered and whether the study is free of unusual statistics, such as implausibly narrow or wide distributions of mean values in participant height, weight or other characteristics, and other red flags. If RCTs fail the checks, then reviewers are instructed to contact the original study authors — and, if the replies are not adequate, to exclude the study.</p><p>“We’re championing the idea that, if a study doesn’t pass these bars, then no hard feelings, but we don’t call it trustworthy enough,” Alfirević explains.</p><p>For Sotiriadis, the merit of this protocol was that it avoided his having to declare the trials faulty or fraudulent; they had merely failed a test of trustworthiness. His team ultimately reported that it excluded the Egyptian trials because they hadn’t been prospectively registered and the authors didn’t explain why.</p><p>Other Cochrane authors are starting to adopt the same protocol. For instance, a review<sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup> of drugs aiming to prevent pre-term labour, published last August, used it to exclude 44 studies — one-quarter of the 122 trials in the literature.</p><h2><b>What counts as trustworthy?</b></h2><p>Whether trustworthiness checks are sometimes unfair to the authors of RCTs, and exactly what should be checked to classify untrustworthy research, is still up for debate. In a 2021 editorial<sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup> introducing the idea of trustworthiness screening, Lisa Bero, a senior research integrity editor at Cochrane, and a bioethicist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, pointed out that there was no validated, universally agreed method.</p><p>“Misclassification of a genuine study as problematic could result in erroneous review conclusions. Misclassification could also lead to reputational damage to authors, legal consequences, and ethical issues associated with participants having taken part in research, only for it to be discounted,” she and two other researchers wrote.</p><p>For now, there are multiple trustworthiness protocols in play. In 2020, for instance, Avenell and others <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03959-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03959-6" data-track-category="body text link">published REAPPRAISED</a>, a checklist aimed more at journal editors. And when Weibel and others reviewed trials investigating ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment last year, they created their own checklist, which they call a ‘research integrity assessment’.</p><p>Bero says some of these checks are more labour-intensive than editors and systematic reviewers are generally accustomed to. “We need to convince systematic reviewers that this is worth their time,” she says. She and others have consulted biomedical researchers, publishers and research-integrity experts to come up with a set of red flags that might serve as the basis for creating a widely agreed method of assessment.</p><p>Despite the concerns of researchers such as Mol, many scientists remain unsure how many reviews have been compromised by unreliable RCTs. This year, a team led by Jack Wilkinson, a health researcher at the University of Manchester, UK, is using the results of Bero’s consultation to apply a list of 76 trustworthiness checks to all trials cited in 50 published Cochrane reviews. (The 76 items include detailed examination of the data and statistics in trials, as well as inspecting details on funding, grants, trial registration, the plausibility of study methods and authors’ publication records — but, in this exercise, data from individual participants are not being requested.)</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The aim is to see how many RCTs fail the checks, and what impact removing those trials would have on the reviews’ conclusions. Wilkinson says a team of 50 is working on the project. He aims to produce a general trustworthiness-screening tool, as well as a separate tool to aid in inspecting participant data, if authors provide them. He will discuss the work in September at Cochrane’s annual colloquium.</p><p>Alfirević’s team, meanwhile, has found in <a href="https://events.cochrane.org/colloquium-2023/session/1473810/assessment-of-trustworthiness-has-a-significant-impact-on-conclusions-of-cochrane-reviews" data-track="click" data-label="https://events.cochrane.org/colloquium-2023/session/1473810/assessment-of-trustworthiness-has-a-significant-impact-on-conclusions-of-cochrane-reviews" data-track-category="body text link">a study yet to be published</a> that 25% of around 350 RCTs in 18 Cochrane reviews on nutrition and pregnancy would have failed trustworthiness checks, using the CPC’s method. With these RCTs excluded, the team found that one-third of the reviews would require updating because their findings would have changed. The researchers will report more details in September.</p><p>In Alfirević’s view, it doesn’t particularly matter which trustworthiness checks reviewers use, as long as they do something to scrutinize RCTs more closely. He warns that the numbers of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that journals publish have themselves been soaring in the past decade — and many of these reviews can’t be trusted because of shoddy screening methods. “An untrustworthy systematic review is far more dangerous than an untrustworthy primary study,” he says. “It is an industry that is completely out of hand, with little quality assurance.”</p><p>Roberts, who first published in 2015 his concerns over problematic medical research in systematic reviews<sup><a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">13</a></sup>, says that the Cochrane organization took six years to respond and still isn’t taking the issue seriously enough. “If up to 25% of trials included in systematic reviews are fraudulent, then the whole Cochrane endeavour is suspect. Much of what we think we know based on systematic reviews is wrong,” he says.</p><p>Bero says that Cochrane consulted widely to develop its 2021 guide on addressing problematic trials, including incorporating suggestions from Roberts, other Cochrane reviewers and research-integrity experts.</p><h2><b>Asking for data</b></h2><p>Many researchers worried by medical fakery agree with Carlisle that it would help if journals routinely asked authors to share their IPD. “Asking for raw data would be a good policy. The default position has just been to trust the study, but we’ve been operating from quite a naive position,” says Wilkinson. That advice, however, runs counter to current practice at most medical journals.</p><p>In 2016, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), an influential body that sets policy for many major medical titles, had proposed requiring mandatory data-sharing from RCTs. But it got pushback — including over perceived risks to the privacy of trial participants who might not have consented to their data being shared, and the availability of resources for archiving the data. As a result, <a href="https://www.icmje.org/news-and-editorials/data_sharing_june_2017.pdf" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.icmje.org/news-and-editorials/data_sharing_june_2017.pdf" data-track-category="body text link">in the latest update to its guidance</a>, in 2017, it settled for merely encouraging data sharing and requiring statements about whether and where data would be shared.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The ICMJE secretary, Christina Wee, says that “there are major feasibility challenges” to be resolved to mandate IPD sharing, although the committee might revisit its practices in future. Many publishers of medical journals told <i>Nature</i>’s news team that, following ICMJE advice, they didn’t require IPD from authors of trials. (These publishers included Springer Nature; <i>Nature</i>’s news team is editorially independent.)</p><p>Some journals, however — including Carlisle’s <i>Anaesthesia</i> — have gone further and do already require IPD. “Most authors provide the data when told it is a requirement,” Carlisle says.</p><p>Even when IPD are shared, says Wilkinson, scouring it in the way that Carlisle does is a time-consuming exercise — creating a further burden for reviewers — although computational checks of statistics might help.</p><p>Besides asking for data, journal editors could also speed up their decision-making, research-integrity specialists say. When sleuths raise concerns, editors should be prepared to put expressions of concern on medical studies more quickly if they don’t hear back from authors, Avenell says. This April, a <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/39343/documents/194466/default" data-track="click" data-label="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/39343/documents/194466/default" data-track-category="body text link">UK parliamentary report into reproducibility and research integrity</a> said that it should not take longer than two months for publishers to publish corrections or retractions of research when academics raise issues.</p><p>And if journals do retract studies, authors of systematic reviews should be required to correct their work, Avenell and others say. This rarely happens. Last year, for instance, Avenell’s team reported that it had carefully and repeatedly e-mailed authors and journal editors of the 88 reviews that cited Sato’s retracted trials to inform them that their reviews included retracted work. They got few responses — only 11 of the 88 reviews have been updated so far — suggesting that authors and editors didn’t generally care about correcting the reviews<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><p>That was dispiriting but not surprising to the team, which <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track-category="body text link">has previously recounted how institutional investigations into Sato’s work were opaque and inadequate</a>. The Cochrane collaboration, for its part, stated in updated guidance in 2021 that systematic reviews must be updated when retractions occur.</p><p>Ultimately, a lingering question is — as with paper mills — why so many suspect RCTs are being produced in the first place. Mol, from his experiences investigating the Egyptian studies, blames lack of oversight and superficial assessments that promote academics on the basis of their number of publications, as well as the lack of stringent checks from institutions and journals on bad practices. Egyptian authorities have taken some steps to improve governance of trials, however; Egypt’s parliament, for instance, published its first clinical research law in December 2020.</p><p>“The solution’s got to be fixes at the source,” says Carlisle. “When this stuff is churned out, it’s like fighting a wildfire and failing.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/linux_desktop_debate/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/linux_desktop_debate/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36770320">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Opinion</span> Linux is now a little more than three 3 per cent of the desktop OS market, excluding the just over <em>four</em> per cent that is ChromeOS. Which is <em>also</em> Linux, but the <em>wrong kind</em> of Linux.</p>
<p>Web server statistics aggregator Statcounter announced last week that as of June 2023, Linux <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide" rel="nofollow">accounts</a> for 3 per cent of desktop operating system use. However, this is still surpassed by ChromeOS, which means that desktop Linux has less than half of the desktop Linux market. If you feel that this is a bit weird, we agree with you.</p>
<p>Apparently, desktop Linux use measures 3.08 per cent, lagging about a quarter behind the usage of ChromeOS at 4.15 per cent. The problem with this is that ChromeOS is <em>also</em> a Linux distribution. It's a strange distro, non-standard in several ways, but current versions are <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/14/chromeos_opinion_column/">built on the basis of Gentoo Linux</a>, switching from an Ubuntu basis some years earlier.</p>

    

<p>We feel that a more accurate reckoning would be that Linux has now reached 7.23 per cent of Statcounter's usage figures, with ChromeOS at just over half: 57.4 per cent of the total. That seems like a more positive interpretation, one that Linux fans would be keen to make, but apparently not. By example, Linux advocacy site Linuxiac doesn't even <a href="https://linuxiac.com/linux-hits-3-percent-market-share/" rel="nofollow">mention</a> ChromeOS in its write-up.</p>

        


        

<p>(As an aside, we suspect that quite a lot of the 3.23 per cent of OSes grouped under "Unknown" are probably <em>also</em> Linux users, just extra-paranoid ones who are obscuring their user-agent or something.)</p>
<p>Why <em>shouldn't</em> ChromeOS count? It's a Linux kernel and a Linux userland on top of the standard <code>glibc</code> C library. You can open a shell. If you want, you can <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/04/27/linux_vms_on_chrome_os/">run a Debian container</a> and once you're in there install and run any Debian app; <em>The Reg</em> FOSS desk's experimental ChromeOS Flex machine runs Firefox and DOSemu.</p>

        

<p>If someone said "Android is not a Linux," that is defensible. You can't easily download it for free, and you can't run it on your own generic off-the-shelf computer. There have been a few experimental Android-based desktop OSes, but so far they've all flopped. On its native platform of smartphones and tablets, you can't run ordinary Linux apps on Android. It's a different sort of beast, even though <em>technically</em> it is a Linux inasmuch as it has a Linux kernel. But that's about it. It even has a weird, non-standard, non-GPL <code>libc</code>, "Bionic". By default and unless cracked, aside from the kernel, it has nothing else Linux-like about it. No shell, no desktop, no X11 or Wayland, nothing.</p>
<p>But that's not the case for ChromeOS. Underneath its unique GUI layer – which, unlike the one in macOS, is <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/lkgr/ash/" rel="nofollow">open source</a> – it's a relatively standard Linux which can run standard Linux apps, out of the box, on both x86 and Arm. As such, it's the most successful desktop Linux there is.</p>
<p>It's not a <em>typical</em> Linux, because typical Linuxes are tools for nerdy hacker types, and that kind of OS will never, ever go mainstream unless someone forces people to use it. (As the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/03/china_openkylin/">government of the People's Republic of China is currently doing</a>, but that is irrelevant to this. No Google inside the Great Firewall means no ChromeOS.)</p>

        

<p>ChromeOS is a desktop Linux with the Linuxiness stripped out. No choice about partitioning. No weird dual-boot mechanisms. No choice of desktops or package managers. No package manager!</p>
<p>But in every way that matters, it is mainstream, it is commercially successful, it's a polished end-user desktop OS, and it's a Linux.</p>
<p>So naturally the Forces of FOSS hate it. Of <em>course</em> they do. And how do they express that contempt? By saying it's not a True Linux.</p>
<p>Unix is like a religion: somehow, it encourages schisms and splinter sects, all of whom deny that the others are legitimate. It's almost a defining characteristic.</p>
<p>Ignoring all the commercial Unixes as <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/17/unix_is_dead/">they are effectively all dead now</a>, and just looking at the FOSS ones, there are about a dozen rival sects: NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonflyBSD, Minix, HURD and L4 and its <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/24/neptune_os_sel4_windows/">various splinter groups</a>, Plan 9 (<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/02/plan_9_fork_9front/">9front</a>, HarveyOS, Jeanne etc.), Inferno, <a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public" rel="nofollow">xv6</a>, <a href="https://www.nordier.com/" rel="nofollow">v7/86</a>, and of course, Linux and its thousand distributions.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/17/almalinux_project_switches_focus/">AlmaLinux project climbs down from being a one-to-one RHEL clone</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/13/wayland_is_coming/">Three signs that Wayland is becoming the favored way to get a GUI on Linux</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/12/suse_announces_rhel_fork/">SUSE announces its own RHEL-compatible distro... again</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/10/oracle_ibm_rhel_code/">Oracle pours fuel all over Red Hat source code drama</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Precisely two (2) Linux-based OSes have enjoyed large-scale commercial success as user-facing GUI systems for non-technical users. One has <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/06/11/android_activation_nears_one_million_daily/">billions of users</a>, the other a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/05/chromebook_shipments_canalys_figures/">significant fraction of a billion</a>. Both are from Google, and both share a defining attribute: the FOSS world rejects them.</p>
<p>ChromeOS comes in two flavors: there's ordinary ChromeOS, which you can only get by buying hardware built to run it (just like Apple's macOS), and there's <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/16/google_chrome_os/">ChromeOS Flex</a>. Flex <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/16/google_chrome_os/">used to be called Neverware Cloudready</a>. Neverware grew from <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/11/08/google_chrome_os_is_not_android/">Hexxeh's remixed and rebuilt ChromiumOS</a> for ordinary PCs. Hexxeh made ChromeOS Flow, and that is the direct grandparent of ChromeOS Flex: both are ChromeOS for generic PC hardware. That is the significant angle. It shows that ChromeOS is just another Linux distro.</p>
<p>ChromeOS Flex is not like Android. It is a Linux in every way that matters. It's both small-f free and it's <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/" rel="nofollow">open source</a>; there have been multiple remixes and rebuilds. It runs on generic kit with ordinary BIOS or UEFI, including with Secure Boot. It has a desktop, albeit its own unique one. You can pop a shell and install and run any arbitrary Linux app.</p>
<p>It looks like a Linux, it acts like a Linux, and it runs like a Linux. It is based on a generic Linux kernel, and it does Linuxy stuff with Linuxy binaries like any other desktop Linux.</p>
<p>It doesn't have systemd, but thank the great god Torvalds and his apostle St Cox that is not yet a requirement for a Linux distro. It has <code>upstart</code>, which was one of the most widespread init systems.</p>
<p>It is 100 percent on-brand for the Linux world that when one specific form of Linux-based OS goes mainstream, and is used by <a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-android-users-are-there" rel="nofollow">approximately half</a> the human race, the True Believers of the Linux world disown it. Android is not a Linux. OK, they kind of have a point.</p>
<p>But ChromeOS, and especially ChromeOS Flex? Of course, all the advocates decry it as not being a True Linux, but then again, this just quickly descends into a <a href="https://www.scribbr.com/fallacies/no-true-scotsman-fallacy/" rel="nofollow">"no true Scotsman"</a> argument. As it is, the Fedora lot think Ubuntu is junk, and the Debianisti think everything else is junk, and the Arch folk think they are the true cutting edge, <a href="http://www.slackware.com/changelog/current.php?cpu=x86_64" rel="nofollow">Slackware</a> enthusiasts consider everyone else newbies, while the NixOS folk think all the rest are still in the stone age somewhere… ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft still doesn’t know — or want to share — how China-backed hackers stole a key that allowed them to stealthily break into dozens of email inboxes, including those belonging to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/12/chinese-hackers-us-government-microsoft-email/"> several federal government agencies</a>.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/14/analysis-of-storm-0558-techniques-for-unauthorized-email-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a blog post</a> Friday, Microsoft said it was a matter of “ongoing investigation” how the hackers obtained a Microsoft signing key that was abused to forge authentication tokens that allowed the hackers’ access to inboxes as if they were the rightful owners. Reports say targets include U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, U.S. State Department officials and other organizations not yet publicly revealed.</p>
<p>Microsoft disclosed the incident last Tuesday, attributing the month-long activity to a newly discovered espionage group it calls Storm-0558, which it believes has a strong nexus to China. U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA said the hacks, which began in mid-May, included <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-193a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a small number</a> of government accounts said to be in the single digits and that the hackers exfiltrated some unclassified email data. While the U.S. government has not publicly attributed the hacks, China’s top foreign ministry spokesperson denied the allegations on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Where China has used previously unknown vulnerabilities to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">individually hack into Microsoft-powered email servers</a> to steal corporate data, this hacking group instead went directly to the source by targeting new and undisclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s cloud.</p>
<p>In its blog post, Microsoft said the hackers acquired one of its consumer signing keys, or MSA key, which the company uses to secure consumer email accounts, like for accessing Outlook.com. Microsoft said it initially thought the hackers were forging authentication tokens using an acquired enterprise signing key, which are used to secure corporate and enterprise email accounts. But, Microsoft found that the hackers were using that consumer MSA key to forge tokens that allowed them to break into enterprise inboxes. Microsoft said this was because of a “validation error in Microsoft code.”</p>
<p>Microsoft said it has blocked “all actor activity” related to this incident, suggesting that the incident is over and that the hackers lost access. Though it’s unclear how Microsoft lost control of its own keys, the company said it’s hardened its key issuance systems, presumably to prevent hackers from churning out another digital skeleton key.</p>
<p>The hackers made one key mistake. By using the same key to raid several inboxes, Microsoft said this allowed investigators “to see all actor access requests which followed this pattern across both our enterprise and consumer systems.” To wit, Microsoft knows who was compromised and said it notified those affected.</p>
<p>With the immediate threat thought to be over, Microsoft now faces scrutiny for its handling of the incident, thought to be the biggest breach of unclassified government data since<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/"> the Russian espionage campaign that hacked SolarWinds</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/07/microsoft-takes-pains-to-obscure-role-in-0-days-that-caused-email-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ars Technica’s Dan Goodin</a>, Microsoft went to great lengths to do damage control in its blog post, avoiding terms like “zero-day,” referring to when a software maker has zero days notice to fix a vulnerability that has already been exploited. Whether or not the bug or its exploitation fits everyone’s definition of a zero-day, Microsoft went out of its way to avoid describing it as such, or even to call it a vulnerability.</p>
<p>Compounding the key leak and its misuse was a lack of visibility into the intrusions by the government departments themselves. Microsoft is also taking heat for reserving security logs for the government accounts with the company’s top-tier package that may have helped other incident responders identify malicious activity.</p>
<p>CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/12/politics/china-based-hackers-us-government-email-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> that the State Department initially detected the breach and reported it to Microsoft. But not every government department had the same level of security logging, which according to The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-hacking-was-undetectable-for-some-who-had-less-expensive-microsoft-services-58730629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a> was available to departments with higher-paid tier Microsoft accounts but not others. Mary Jo Foley, editor in chief of Directions on Microsoft, a consultancy firm for Microsoft customers, said in <a href="https://www.directionsonmicrosoft.com/blog/2023-07-17/microsofts-latest-email-hack-m365-e3-subscribers-beware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post Monday</a>&nbsp;that the lower government tier offers some logging, but “does not keep track of specific mailbox data which would have revealed the attack.” A CISA official criticized the lack of available logging in a call with reporters last week. Microsoft told the Journal that it was “evaluating feedback.”</p>
<p>Microsoft’s expanded disclosure on Friday offered a glimmer of more technical details and indicators of compromise that incident responders can check if their networks were targeted, the technology giant still has questions to answer. Whether or not Microsoft has the answers ready, it’s not likely to be an investigation the technology giant can shake any time soon.</p>

<h2>Welcome to SWIG</h2>

<p>
SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in
C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming
languages.  SWIG is used with different types of target languages including common scripting languages such as
Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby. The list of 
<a href="https://www.swig.org/compat.html#SupportedLanguages">supported languages</a> also includes 
non-scripting languages such as C#, D, Go language,
Java including Android, Lua, OCaml, Octave, Scilab and R.
Also several interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme/Racket)
are supported. SWIG is most
commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming
environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software. 
SWIG is typically used to parse C/C++ interfaces and generate the 'glue code' required for the above target languages to call into the C/C++ code.
SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML.
SWIG is free software and the code that SWIG generates is compatible with both commercial and non-commercial projects.

<h2 id="ais-and-alien-minds">AIs and Alien Minds</h2>
<p>How do <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/language-and-communication/">alien minds perceive the world</a>? It’s an old and oft-debated question in philosophy. And it now turns out to also be a question that rises to prominence in connection with the <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/">concept of the ruliad</a> that’s emerged from our <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wolfram Physics Project</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve wondered about alien minds for a long time—and tried all sorts of ways to imagine what it might be like to see things from their point of view. But in the past I’ve never really had a way to build my intuition about it. That is, until now. So, what’s changed? It’s AI. Because in AI we finally have an accessible form of alien mind.<span id="more-52580"></span></p>
<p>We typically go to <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/">a lot of trouble to train</a> our AIs to produce results that are like we humans would do. But what if we take a human-aligned AI, and modify it? Well, then we get something that’s in effect an alien AI—an AI aligned not with us humans, but with an alien mind.</p>
<p>So how can we see what such an alien AI—or alien mind—is “thinking”? A convenient way is to try to capture its “mental imagery”: the image it forms in its “mind’s eye”. Let’s say we use a typical <a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ImageSynthesize.html">generative AI</a> to go from a description in human language—like “a cat in a party hat”—to a generated image:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323img2.png" alt="" title="" width="149" height="149"> </p>
</div>
<p>It’s exactly the kind of image we’d expect—which isn’t surprising, because it <a href="https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/StableDiffusionSynthesize/">comes from a generative AI</a> that’s trained to “do as we would”. But now let’s imagine taking the neural net that implements this generative AI, and modifying its insides—say by resetting <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#neural-nets">weights that appear in its neural net</a>.</p>
<p>By doing this we’re in effect going from a human-aligned neural net to some kind of “alien” one. But this “alien” neural net will still produce some kind of image—because that’s what a neural net like this does. But what will the image be? Well, in effect, it’s showing us the mental imagery of the “alien mind” associated with the modified neural net. </p>
<p>But what does it actually look like? Well, here’s a sequence obtained by progressively modifying the neural net—in effect making it “progressively more alien”:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec1img3.png" alt="" title="" width="612" height="201"> </p>
</div>
<p>At the beginning it’s still a very recognizable picture of “a cat in a party hat”. But it soon becomes more and more alien: the mental image in effect diverges further from the human one—until it no longer “looks like a cat”, and in the end looks, at least to us, rather random. </p>
<p>There are many details of how this works that we’ll be discussing below. But what’s important is that—by studying the effects of changing the neural net—we now have a systematic “experimental” platform for probing at least one kind of “alien mind”. We can think of what we’re doing as a kind of “artificial neuroscience”, probing not actual human brains, but neural net analogs of them.</p>
<p>And we’ll see many parallels to neuroscience experiments. For example, we’ll often be “knocking out” particular parts of our “neural net brain”, a little like how injuries such as strokes can knock out parts of a human brain. But we know that when a human brain suffers a stroke, this can lead to phenomena like “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemispatial_neglect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemispatial neglect</a>”, in which a stroke victim asked to draw a clock will end up drawing just one side of the clock—a little like the pictures of cats “degrade” when parts of the “neural net brain” are knocked out. </p>
<p>Of course, there are many differences between real brains and artificial neural nets. But most of the core phenomena we’ll observe here seem robust and fundamental enough that we can expect them to span very different kinds of “brains”—human, artificial and alien. And the result is that we can begin to build up intuition about what the worlds of different—and alien—minds can be like. </p>
<h2 id="generating-images-with-ais">Generating Images with AIs</h2>
<p>How does an AI manage to create a picture, say of a cat in a party hat? Well, the AI has to be trained on “what makes a reasonable picture”—and how to determine what a picture is of. Then in some sense what the AI does is to start generating “reasonable” pictures at random, in effect continually checking what the picture it’s generating seems to be “of”, and tweaking it to guide it towards being a picture of what one wants.</p>
<p>So what counts as a “reasonable picture”? If one looks at billions of pictures—say on the web—there are lots of regularities. For example, the pixels aren’t random; nearby ones are usually highly correlated. If there’s a face, it’s usually more or less symmetrical. It’s more common to have blue at the top of a picture, and green at the bottom. And so on. And the important technological point is that it turns out to be possible to use a neural network to capture regularities in images, and to generate random images that exhibit them.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of “random images” generated in this way:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec2img1.jpg" alt="" title="" width="624" height="834"> </p>
</div>
<p>And the idea is that these images—while each is “random” in its specifics—will in general follow the “statistics” of the billions of images from the web on which the neural network has been “trained”. We’ll be talking more about images like these later. But for now suffice it to say that while some may just look like abstract patterns, others seem to contain things like landscapes, human forms, etc. And what’s notable is that none just look like “random arrays of pixels”; they all show some kind of “structure”. And, yes, given that they’ve been trained from pictures on the web, it’s not too surprising that the “structure” sometimes includes things like human forms. </p>
<p>But, OK, let’s say we specifically want a picture of a cat in a party hat. From all of the almost infinitely large number of possible “well-structured” random images we might generate, how do we get one that’s of a cat in a party hat? Well, a first question is: how would we know if we’ve succeeded? As humans, we could just look and see what our image is of. But it turns out we can also <a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ImageIdentify.html">train a neural net to do this</a> (and, no, it <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/05/wolfram-language-artificial-intelligence-the-image-identification-project/">doesn’t always get it exactly right</a>):</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec2img3.png" alt="" title="" width="610" height="108"> </p>
</div>
<p>How is the <a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NetTrain.html">neural net trained</a>? The basic idea is to take billions of images—say from the web—for which corresponding captions have been provided. Then one progressively tweaks the parameters of the neural net to make it reproduce these captions when it’s fed the corresponding images. But the critical point is the <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#neural-nets">neural net turns out to do more</a>: it also successfully produces “reasonable” captions for images it’s never seen before. What does “reasonable” mean? Operationally, it means captions that are similar to what we humans might assign. And, yes, it’s far from obvious that a computationally constructed neural net will behave at all like us humans, and the fact that it does <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/">is presumably telling us</a> fundamental things about how human brains work.</p>
<p>But for now what’s important is that we can use this captioning capability to progressively guide images we produce towards what we want. Start from “pure randomness”. Then try to “structure the randomness” to make a “reasonable” picture, but at every step see in effect “what the caption would be”. And try to “go in a direction” that “leads towards” a picture with the caption we want. Or, in other words, progressively try to get to a picture that’s of what we want. </p>
<p>The way this is set up in practice, one starts from an array of random pixels, then iteratively forms the picture one wants:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec2img5.jpg" alt="" title="" width="612" height="196"> </p>
</div>
<p>Different initial arrays lead to different final pictures—though if everything works correctly, the final pictures will all be of “what one asked for”, in this case a cat in a party hat (and, yes, there are a few “glitches”):</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec2img6.png" alt="" title="" width="618" height="198"> </p>
</div>
<p>We don’t know how mental images are formed in human brains. But it seems conceivable that the process is not too different. And that in effect as we’re trying to “conjure up a reasonable image”, we’re continually checking if it’s aligned with what we want—so that, for example, if our checking process is impaired we can end up with a different image, as in hemispatial neglect. </p>
<h2 id="the-notion-of-interconcept-space">The Notion of Interconcept Space</h2>
<p>That everything can ultimately be represented in terms of digital data is foundational to the whole computational paradigm. But the effectiveness of neural nets relies on the slightly different idea that it’s useful to treat at least many kinds of things as being characterized by arrays of real numbers. In the end one might extract from a neural net that’s giving captions to images the word “cat”. But inside the neural net it’ll operate with arrays of numbers that correspond in some fairly abstract way to the image you’ve given, and the textual caption it’ll finally produce.</p>
<p>And in general neural nets can typically be thought of as associating “feature vectors” with things—whether those things are images, text, or anything else. But whereas words like “cat” and “dog” are discrete, the <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#the-concept-of-embeddings">feature vectors associated with them</a> just contain collections of real numbers. And this means that we can think of a whole space of possibilities, with “cat” and “dog” just corresponding to two specific points. </p>
<p>So what’s out there in that space of possibilities? For the feature vectors we typically deal with in practice <a href="https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/CLIP-Multi-domain-Feature-Extractor/">the space is many-thousand-dimensional</a>. But we can for example look at the (nominally straight) line from the “dog point” to the “cat point” in this space, and even generate sample images of what comes between:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec3Aimg1.png" alt="" title="" width="609" height="196"> </p>
</div>
<p>And, yes, if we want to, we can keep going “beyond cat”—and pretty soon things start becoming quite weird:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec3Aimg2.png" alt="" title="" width="610" height="196"> </p>
</div>
<p>We can also do things like look at the line from a plane to a cat—and, yes, there’s strange stuff in there (wings <img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123rightarrow.png" alt="" width="16" height=" "> hat <img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123rightarrow.png" alt="" width="16" height=" "> ears?):</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec3Aimg3.png" alt="" title="" width="619" height="199"> </p>
</div>
<p>What about elsewhere? For example, what happens “around” our standard “cat in a party hat”? With the <a href="https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/CLIP-Multi-domain-Feature-Extractor/">particular setup we’re using</a>, there’s a 2304-dimensional space of possibilities. But as an example, we look at what we get on a particular 2D plane through the “standard cat” point:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3-45img1A.jpeg" alt="" title="" width="621" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>Our “standard cat” is in the middle. But as we move away from the “standard cat” point, progressively weirder things happen. For a while there are recognizable (if perhaps demonic) cats to be seen. But soon there isn’t much “catness” in evidence—though sometimes hats do remain (in what we might characterize as an “all hat, no cat” situation, reminiscent of the Texan “all hat, no cattle”). </p>
<p>How about if we pick other planes through the standard cat point? All sorts of images appear:</p>

<p>But the fundamental story is always the same: there’s a kind of “cat island”, beyond which there are weird and only vaguely cat-related images—encircled by an “ocean” of what seem like purely abstract patterns with no obvious cat connection. And in general the picture that emerges is that in the immense space of possible “statistically reasonable” images, there are islands dotted around that correspond to “<a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/#the-concept-of-concepts">linguistically describable concepts</a>”—like cats in party hats. </p>
<p>The islands normally seem to be roughly “spherical”, in the sense that they extend about the same nominal distance in every direction. But relative to the whole space, each island is absolutely tiny—something like perhaps a fraction 2<sup>–2000</sup> ≈ 10<sup>–600</sup> of the volume of the whole space. And between these islands there lie huge expanses of what we might call “interconcept space”. </p>
<p>What’s out there in interconcept space? It’s full of images that are “statistically reasonable” based on the images we humans have put on the web, etc.—but aren’t of things we humans have come up with words for. It’s as if in developing our civilization—and our human language—we’ve “colonized” only certain small islands in the space of all possible concepts, leaving vast amounts of interconcept space unexplored. </p>
<p>What’s out there is pretty weird—and sometimes a bit disturbing. Here’s what we see zooming in on the same (randomly chosen) plane around “cat island” as above:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Yimg1B.jpg" alt="" title="" width="617" height="620"> </p>
</div>

<p>What are all these things? In a sense, words fail us. They’re things on the shores of interconcept space, where human experience has not (yet) taken us, and for which human language has not been developed.</p>
<p>What if we venture further out into interconcept space—and for example just sample points in the space at random? It’s just like we already saw above: we’ll get images that are somehow “statistically typical” of what we humans have put on the web, etc., and on which our AI was trained. Here are a few more examples:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Zimg1.jpg" alt="" title="" width="620" height="828"> </p>
</div>
<p>And, yes, we can pick out at least two basic classes of images: ones that seem like “pure abstract textures”, and ones that seem “representational”, and remind us of real-world scenes from human experience. There are intermediate cases—like “textures” with structures that seem like they might “represent something”, and “representational-seeming” images where we just can’t place what they might be representing.</p>
<p>But when we do see recognizable “real-world-inspired” images they’re a curious reflection of the concepts—and general imagery—that we humans find “interesting enough to put on the web”. We’re not dealing here with some kind of “arbitrary interconcept space”; we’re dealing with “human-aligned” interconcept space that’s in a sense anchored to human concepts, but extends between and around them. And, yes, viewed in these terms it becomes quite unsurprising that in the interconcept space we’re sampling, there are so many images that remind us of human forms and common human situations. </p>
<p>But just what were the images that the AI saw, from which it formed this model of interconcept space? There were a <a href="https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few billion of them, “foraged” from the web</a>. Like things on the web in general, it’s a motley collection; here’s a random sample:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071523sec3photogridimg1.jpg" alt="" title="" width="620" height="394"> </p>
</div>
<p>Some can be thought of as capturing aspects of “life as it is”, but many are more aspirational, coming from staged and often promotionally oriented photography. And, yes, there are lots of Net-a-Porter-style “clothing-without-heads” images. There are also lots of images of “things”—like food, etc. But somehow when we sample randomly in interconcept space it’s the human forms that most distinctively stand out, conceivably because “things” are not particularly consistent in their structure, but human forms always have a certain consistency of “head-body-arms, etc.” structure.</p>
<p>It’s notable, though, that even the most real-world-like images we find by randomly sampling interconcept space seem to typically be “painterly” and “artistic” rather than “photorealistic” and “photographic”. It’s a different story close to “concept points”—like on cat island. There more photographic forms are common, though as we go away from the “actual concept point”, there’s a tendency towards either a rather toy-like appearance, or something more like an illustration.</p>
<p>By the way, even the most “photographic” images the AI generates won’t be anything that comes directly from the training set. Because—as we’ll discuss later—the AI is not set up to directly store images; instead its training process in effect “grinds up” images to extract their “statistical properties”. And while “statistical features” of the original images will show up in what the AI generates, any detailed arrangement of pixels in them is overwhelmingly unlikely to do so.</p>
<p>But, OK, what happens if we start not at a “describable concept” (like “a cat in a party hat”), but just at a random point in interconcept space? Here are the kinds of things we see:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Zimg3.jpg" alt="" title="" width="616" height="616"> </p>
</div>

<p>The images often seem to be a bit more diverse than those around “known concept points” (like our “cat point” above). And occasionally there’ll be a “flash” of something “representationally familiar” (perhaps like a human form) that’ll show up. But most of the time we won’t be able to say “what these images are of”. They’re of things that are somehow “statistically” like what we’ve seen, but they’re not things that are familiar enough that we’ve—at least so far—developed a way to describe them, say with words.</p>
<h2 id="the-images-of-interconcept-space">The Images of Interconcept Space</h2>
<p>There’s something strangely familiar—yet unfamiliar—to many of the images in interconcept space. It’s fairly common to see pictures that seem like they’re of people:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img1.jpg" alt="" title="" width="607" height="295"> </p>
</div>
<p>But they’re “not quite right”. And for us as humans, being particularly attuned to faces, it’s the faces that tend to seem the most wrong—even though other parts are “wrong” as well.</p>
<p>And perhaps in commentary on our nature as a social species (or maybe it’s as a social media species), there’s a great tendency to see pairs or larger groups of people:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img2.jpg" alt="" title="" width="615" height="300"> </p>
</div>
<p>There’s also a strange preponderance of torso-only pictures—presumably the result of “fashion shots” in the training data (and, yes, with some rather wild “fashion statements”):</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img3.png" alt="" title="" width="618" height="146"> </p>
</div>
<p>People are by far the most common identifiable elements. But one does sometimes see other things too:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img4.png" alt="" title="" width="620" height="145"> </p>
</div>
<p>Then there are some landscape-type scenes:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img5.png" alt="" title="" width="618" height="146"> </p>
</div>
<p>Some look fairly photographically literal, but others build up the impression of landscapes from more abstract elements: </p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img6.jpg" alt="" title="" width="619" height="302"> </p>
</div>
<p>Occasionally there are cityscape-like pictures:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img7.png" alt="" title="" width="621" height="146"> </p>
</div>
<p>And—still more rarely—indoor-like scenes:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img8Bpng-1A.png" alt="" title="" width="620" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>Then there are pictures that look like they’re “exteriors” of some kind:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img9.png" alt="" title="" width="617" height="145"> </p>
</div>
<p>It’s common to see images built up from lines or dots or otherwise “impressionistically formed”:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img10A.jpg" alt="" title="" width="619" height="460"> </p>
</div>
<p>And then there are lots of images of that seem like they’re trying to be “of something”, but it’s not at all clear what that “thing” is, and whether indeed it’s something we humans would recognize, or whether instead it’s something somehow “fundamentally alien”:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img12.jpg" alt="" title="" width="619" height="939"> </p>
</div>
<p>It’s also quite common to see what look more like “pure patterns”—that don’t really seem like they’re “trying to be things”, but more come across like “decorative textures”:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img13.jpg" alt="" title="" width="620" height="620"> </p>
</div>
<p>But probably the single most common type of images are somewhat uniform textures, formed by repeating various simple elements, though usually with “dislocations” of various kinds: </p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img14.jpg" alt="" title="" width="620" height="302"> </p>
</div>
<p>Across interconcept space there’s tremendous variety to the images we see. Many have a certain artistic quality to them—and a feeling that they are some kind of “mindful interpretation” of a perhaps mundane thing in the world, or a simple, essentially mathematical pattern. And to some extent the “mind” involved is a collective version of our human one, reflected in a neural net that has “experienced” some of the many images humans have put on the web, etc. But in some ways the mind is also a more alien one, formed from the computational structure of the neural net, with its particular features, and no doubt in some ways computationally irreducible behavior.</p>
<p>And indeed there are some motifs that show up repeatedly that are presumably reflections of features of the underlying structure of the neural net. The “granulated” appearance, with alternation between light and dark, for example, is presumably a consequence of the dynamics of the convolutional parts of the neural net—and analogous to the results of what amounts to iterated blurring and sharpening with a certain effective pixel scale (reminiscent, for example, of video feedback):</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img15.jpg" alt="" title="" width="609" height="236"> </p>
</div>
<h2 id="making-minds-alien">Making Minds Alien</h2>
<p>We can think of what we’ve done so far as exploring what a mind trained from human-like experiences can “imagine” by generalizing from those experiences. But what might a different kind of mind imagine?</p>
<p>As a very rough approximation, we can think of just taking the trained “mind” we’ve created, and explicitly modifying it, then seeing what it now “imagines”. Or, more specifically, we can take the neural net we have been using, and start making changes to it, and seeing what effect that has on the images it produces.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss later the details of how the network is set up, but suffice it to say here that it <a href="https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/StableDiffusionSynthesize/">involves 391 distinct internal modules</a>, involving altogether nearly a billion numerical weights. When the network is trained, those numerical weights are carefully tuned to achieve the results we want. But what if we just change them? We’ll still (normally) get a network that can generate images. But in some sense it’ll be “thinking differently”—so potentially the images will be different. </p>
<p>So as a very coarse first experiment—reminiscent of many that are done in biology—let’s just “knock out” each successive module in turn, setting all its weights to zero. If we ask the resulting network to generate a picture of “a cat in a party hat”, here’s what we now get:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec5Aimg1B.jpg" alt="" title="" width="610" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>Let’s look at these results in a bit more detail. In quite a few cases, zeroing out a single module doesn’t make much of a difference; for example, it might basically only change the facial expression of the cat:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5Bimg1C.jpg" alt="" title="" width="610" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>But it can also more fundamentally change the cat (and its hat):</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5Bimg2C.jpg" alt="" title="" width="610" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>It can change the configuration or position of the cat (and, yes, some of those paws are not anatomically correct):</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5Bimg3C.jpg" alt="" title="" width="610" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>Zeroing out other modules can in effect change the “rendering” of the cat:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5Bimg4C.jpg" alt="" title="" width="610" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>But in other cases things can get much more mixed up, and difficult for us to parse:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5Bimg5C.jpg" alt="" title="" width="610" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes there’s clearly a cat there, but its presentation is at best odd:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5Bimg6C.jpg" alt="" title="" width="609" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>And sometimes we get images that have definite structure, but don’t seem to have anything to do with cats:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5Bimg7C.jpg" alt="" title="" width="610" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>Then there are cases where we basically just get “noise”, albeit with things superimposed:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5Bimg8C.jpg" alt="" title="" width="610" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>But—much like in neurophysiology—there are some modules (like the very first and last ones in our original list) where zeroing them out basically makes the system not work at all, and just generate “pure random noise”.</p>
<p>As we’ll discuss below, the whole <a href="https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/StableDiffusionSynthesize/">neural net that we’re using</a> has a fairly complex internal structure—for example, with a few fundamentally different kinds of modules. But here’s a sample of what happens if one zeros out modules at different places in the network—and what we see is that for the most part there’s no obvious correlation between where the module is, and what effect zeroing it out will have:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5Cimg1A.png" alt="" title="" width="620" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>So far, we’ve just looked at what happens if we zero out a single module at a time. Here are some randomly chosen examples of what happens if one zeros out successively more modules (one might call this a “HAL experiment” in remembrance of the fate of the <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/04/learning-about-the-future-from-2001-a-space-odyssey-fifty-years-later/">fictional HAL AI in the movie <em>2001</em></a>):</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5KBimg1.jpg" alt="" title="" width="617" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>And basically once the “catness” of the images is lost, things become more and more alien from there on out, ending either in apparent randomness, or sometimes barren “zeroness”.</p>
<p>Rather than zeroing out modules, we can instead <a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NetInitialize.html">randomize the weights</a> in them (perhaps a bit like the effect of a tumor rather than a stroke in a brain)—but the results are usually at least qualitatively similar:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5KBimg2A.jpg" alt="" title="" width="618" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>Something else we can do is just to progressively mix randomness uniformly into every weight in the network (perhaps a bit like globally “drugging” a brain). Here are three examples where in each case 0%, 1%, 2%, … of randomness was added—all “fading away” in a very similar way:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5KBimg3A.jpg" alt="" title="" width="617" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>And similarly, we can progressively scale down towards zero (in 1% increments: 100%, 99%, 98%, …) all the weights in the network:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5Cimg8B.jpg" alt="" title="" width="619" height=""> </p>
</div>
<p>Or we can progressively increase the numerical values of the weights—eventually in some sense “blowing the mind” of the network (and going a bit “psychedelic” in the process):</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5Cimg9B.jpg" alt="" title="" width="617" height=""> </p>

<h2 id="minds-in-rulial-space">Minds in Rulial Space</h2>
<p>We can think of what we’ve done so far as exploring some of the “natural history” of what’s out there in generative AI space—or as providing a small taste of at least one approximation to the kind of mental imagery one might encounter in alien minds. But how does this fit into a more general picture of alien minds and what they might be like?</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/">concept of the ruliad</a> we finally have a principled way to <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#alien-views-of-the-ruliad">talk about alien minds</a>—at least at a theoretical level. And the key point is that any alien mind—or, for that matter, any mind—can be thought of as “observing” or sampling the ruliad from its own particular point of view, or in effect, its own position in rulial space.</p>
<p>The ruliad is defined to be the entangled limit of all possible computations: a unique object with an inevitable structure. And the idea is that anything—whether one interprets it as a phenomenon or an observer—must be part of the ruliad. The key to our <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physics Project</a> is then that “observers like us” have <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/">certain general characteristics</a>. We are computationally bounded, with “finite minds” and limited sensory input. And we have a certain coherence that comes from our belief in our persistence in time, and our consistent thread of experience. And what we then discover in our Physics Project is the rather remarkable result that from these characteristics and the general properties of the ruliad alone it’s essentially inevitable that we must perceive the universe to exhibit the fundamental physical laws it does, in particular the three big theories of twentieth-century physics: general relativity, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. </p>
<p>But what about more detailed aspects of what we perceive? Well, that will depend on more detailed aspects of us as observers, and of how our minds are set up. And in a sense, each different possible mind can be thought of as existing in a certain place in rulial space. Different human minds are mostly close in rulial space, animal minds further away, and more alien minds still further. But how can we characterize what these minds are “thinking about”, or how these minds “perceive things”?</p>
<p>From inside our own minds we can form a sense of what we perceive. But we don’t really have good ways to reliably probe what another mind perceives. But what about what another mind imagines? Well, that’s where what we’ve been doing here comes in. Because with generative AI we’ve got a mechanism for exposing the “mental imagery” of an “AI mind”. </p>
<p>We could consider doing this with words and text, say with an LLM. But for us humans images have a certain fluidity that text does not. Our eyes and brains can perfectly well “see” and absorb images even if we don’t “understand” them. But it’s very difficult for us to absorb text that we don’t “understand”; it usually tends to seem just like a kind of “word soup”. </p>
<p>But, OK, so we generate “mental imagery” from “minds” that have been “made alien” by various modifications. How come we humans can understand anything such minds make? Well, it’s bit like one person being able to understand the thoughts of another. Their brains—and minds—are built differently. And their “internal view” of things will inevitably be different. But the crucial idea—that’s for example central to language—is that it’s possible to “package up” thoughts into something that be “transported” to another mind. Whatever some particular internal thought might be, by the time we can express it with words in a language, it’s possible to communicate it to another mind that will “unpack” it into different internal thoughts.</p>
<p>It’s a nontrivial fact of physics that <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/">“pure motion” in physical space is possible</a>; in other words, that an “object” can be moved “without change” from one place in physical space to another. And now, in a sense, we’re asking about <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/#motion-in-rulial-space">pure motion in rulial space</a>: can we move something “without change” from one mind at one place in rulial space to another mind at another place? In physical space, things like particles—as well as things like black holes—are the fundamental elements that are imagined to move without change. So what’s now the analog in rulial space? It seems to be concepts—as often, for example, represented by words. </p>
<p>So what does that mean for our exploration of generative AI “alien minds”? We can ask whether when we move from one potentially alien mind to another concepts are preserved. We don’t have a perfect proxy for this (though we could make a better one by appropriately training neural net classifiers). But as a first approximation this is like asking whether as we “change the mind”—or move in rulial space—we can still recognize the “concept” the mind produces. Or, in other words, if we start with a “mind” that’s generating a cat in a party hat, will we still recognize the concepts of cat or hat in what a “modified mind” produces? </p>
<p>And what we’ve seen is that sometimes we do, and sometimes we don’t. And for example when we looked at “cat island” we saw a certain boundary beyond which we could no longer recognize “catness” in the image that was produced. And by studying things like cat island (and particularly its analogs when not just the “prompt” but also the underlying neural net is changed) it should be possible to map out how far concepts “extend” across alien minds.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to think about a kind of inverse question: just what is the <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/#the-emerging-picture-of-rulial-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extent of a mind in rulial space</a>? Or, in other words, what range of points of view, ultimately about the ruliad, can it hold? Will it be “narrow-minded”, able to think only in particular ways, with particular concepts? Or will it be more “broad-minded”, encompassing more ways of thinking, with more concepts?</p>
<p>In a sense the whole arc of the intellectual development of our civilization can be thought of as corresponding to an expansion in rulial space: with us progressively being able to think in new ways, and about new things. And as we expand in rulial space, we are in effect encompassing more of what we previously would have had to consider the domain of an alien mind.</p>
<p>When we look at images produced by generative AI away from the specifics of human experience—say in interconcept space, or with modified rules of generation—we may at first be able to make little from them. Like inkblots or arrangements of stars we’ll often find ourselves wanting to say that what we see looks like this or that thing we know.</p>
<p>But the real question is whether we can devise some way of describing what we see that allows us to build thoughts on what we see, or “reason” about it. And what’s very typical is that we manage to do this when we come up with a general “symbolic description” of what we see, say captured with words in natural language (or, now, <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/">computational language</a>). Before we have those words, or that symbolic description, we’ll tend just not to absorb what we see.</p>
<p>And so, for example, even though <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p187--substitution-systems-and-fractals/">nested patterns</a> have always existed in nature, and were even explicitly <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/#lessons-from-the-past">created by mosaic artisans in the early 1200s</a>, they seem to have never been systematically noticed or discussed at all until the latter part of the 20th century, when finally the framework of “fractals” was developed for talking about them. </p>
<p>And so it may be with many of the forms we’ve seen here. As of today, we have no name for them, no systematic framework for thinking about them, and no reason to view them as important. But particularly if the things we do repeatedly show us such forms, we’ll eventually come up with names for them, and start incorporating them into the domain that our minds cover. </p>
<p>And in a sense what we’ve done here can be thought of as showing us a preview of what’s out there in rulial space, in what’s currently the domain of alien minds. In the general exploration of <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/ruliology/">ruliology</a>, and the investigation of what arbitrary simple programs in the computational universe do, we’re able to jump far across the ruliad. But it’s typical that what we see is not something we can connect to things we’re familiar with. In what we’re doing here, we’re moving only much smaller distances in rulial space. We’re starting from generative AI that’s closely aligned with current human development—having been trained from images that we humans have put on the web, etc. But then we’re making small changes to our “AI mind”, and looking at what it now generates. </p>
<p>What we see is often surprising. But it’s still close enough to where we “currently are” in rulial space that we can—at least to some extent—absorb and reason about what we’re seeing. Still, the images often don’t “make sense” to us. And, yes, quite possibly the AI has invented something that has a rich and “meaningful” inner structure. But it’s just that we don’t (yet) have a way to talk about it—and if we did, it would immediately “make perfect sense” to us. </p>
<p>So if we see something we don’t understand, can we just “train a translator”? At some level the answer must be yes. Because the <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/">Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> implies that ultimately there’s a fundamental uniformity to the ruliad. But the problem is that the translator is likely to have to do an <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/">irreducible amount of computational work</a>. And so it won’t be implementable by a “mind like ours”. Still, even though we can’t create a “general translator” we can expect that certain features of what we see will still be translatable—in effect by exploiting certain pockets of computational reducibility that must necessarily exist even when the system as a whole is full of computational irreducibility. And operationally what this means in our case is that the AI may in effect have found certain regularities or patterns that we don’t happen to have noticed but that are useful in exploring further from the “current human point” in rulial space.</p>
<p>It’s very challenging to get an intuitive understanding of what rulial space is like. But the approach we’ve taken here is for me a promising first effort in “humanizing” rulial space, and seeing just how we might be able to relate to what is so far the domain of alien minds. </p>

<h2 id="appendix-how-does-the-generative-ai-work?">Appendix: How Does the Generative AI Work?</h2>
<p>In the main part of this piece, we’ve mostly just talked about what generative AI does, not how it works inside. Here I’ll go a little deeper into what’s inside the particular type of generative AI system that I’ve used in my explorations. It’s a <a href="https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/StableDiffusionSynthesize/">method called stable diffusion</a>, and its operation is in many ways both clever and surprising. As it’s implemented today it’s steeped in fairly complicated engineering details. To what extent these will ultimately be necessary isn’t clear. But in any case here I’ll mostly concentrate on general principles, and on giving a broad outline of how generative AI can be used to produce images.</p>
<h3 id="the-distribution-of-typical-images">The Distribution of Typical Images</h3>
<p>At the core of generative AI is the ability to produce things of some particular type that “follow the patterns of” known things of that type. So, for example, <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/">large language models (LLMs)</a> are intended to produce text that “follows the patterns” of text written by humans, say on the web. And generative AI systems for images are similarly intended to produce images that “follow the patterns” of images put on the web, etc. </p>
<p>But what kinds of patterns exist in typical images, say on the web? Here are some examples of “typical images”—scaled down to 32×32 pixels and taken from a <a href="https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/resources/CIFAR-100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standard set of 60,000 images</a>:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img1.png" alt="" title="" width="642" height="155"> </p>
</div>
<p>And as a very first thing, we can ask what colors show up in these images. They’re not uniform in RGB space: </p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img2.png" alt="" title="" width="192" height="72"> </p>
</div>
<p>But what about the positions of different colors? Adjusting to accentuate color differences, the “average image” turns out to have a curious “HAL’s eye” look (presumably with blue for sky at the top, and brown for earth at the bottom): </p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img3.png" alt="" title="" width="67" height="67"> </p>
</div>
<p>But just picking pixels separately—even with the color distribution inferred from actual images—won’t produce images that in any way look “natural” or “realistic”: </p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img4.png" alt="" title="" width="630" height="48"> </p>
</div>
<p>And the immediate issue is that the pixels aren’t really independent; most pixels in most images are correlated in color with nearby pixels. And in a first approximation one can capture this for example by <a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LearnDistribution.html">fitting the list of colors of all the pixels</a> to a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix that represents their correlation. <a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RandomVariate.html">Sampling from this distribution</a> gives images like these—that indeed look somehow “statistically natural”, even if there isn’t appropriate detailed structure in them:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img5A.png" alt="" title="" width="630" height="158"> </p>
</div>
<p>So, OK, how can one do better? The basic idea is to use neural nets, which can in effect encode detailed long-range connections between pixels. In some way it’s similar to <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#inside-chatgpt">what’s done in LLMs like ChatGPT</a>—where one has to deal with long-range connections between words in text. But for images it’s structurally a bit more difficult, because in some sense one has to “consistently fit together 2D patches” rather than just progressively extend a 1D sequence.</p>
<p>And the typical way this is done at first seems a bit bizarre. The basic idea is to start with a random array of pixels—corresponding in effect to “pure noise”—and then progressively to “reduce the noise” to end up with a “reasonable image” that follows the patterns of typical images, all the while guided by some prompt that says what one wants the “reasonable image” to be of.</p>
<h3 id="attractors-and-inverse-diffusion">Attractors and Inverse Diffusion</h3>
<p>How does one go from randomness to definite “reasonable” things? The key is to use the <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-6--starting-from-randomness#sect-6-7--the-notion-of-attractors">notion of attractors</a>. In a very simple case, one might have a system—like this “mechanical” example—where from any “randomly chosen” initial condition one also evolves to one of (here) two definite (fixed-point) attractors:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img6.png" alt="" title="" width="573" height="62"> </p>
</div>
<p>One has something similar in a neural net that’s for example <a href="https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/050b1a0a-f43a-4c28-b7e0-72607a918467/">trained to recognize digits</a>:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img7.png" alt="" title="" width="649" height="30"> </p>
</div>
<p>Regardless of exactly how each digit is written, or noise that gets added to it, the network will take this input and evolve to an attractor corresponding to a digit. </p>
<p>Sometimes there can be lots of attractors. Like in <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-6--starting-from-randomness#sect-6-2--four-classes-of-behavior">this (“class 2”) cellular automaton</a> evolving down the page, many different initial conditions can lead to the same attractor, but there are many possible attractors, corresponding to different final patterns of stripes:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img8.png" alt="" title="" width="665" height="75"> </p>
</div>
<p>The same can be true for example in 2D cellular automata, where now the attractors can be thought of as being different “images” with structure determined by the cellular automaton rule:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img9.png" alt="" title="" width="679" height="172"> </p>
</div>
<p>But what if one wants to arrange to have particular images as attractors? Here’s where the somewhat surprising idea of “stable diffusion” can be used. Imagine we start with two possible images, <img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png" alt="" width="11" height=" "> and <img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/B2helvetica.png" alt="" width="11" height=" ">, and then in a series of steps progressively add noise to them:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img10.png" alt="" title="" width="679" height="192"> </p>
</div>
<p>Here’s the bizarre thing we now want to do: train a neural net to take the image we get at a particular step, and “go backwards”, removing noise from it. The neural net we’ll use for this is somewhat complicated, with “<a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ConvolutionLayer.html">convolutional</a>” pieces that basically operate on blocks of nearby pixels, and “<a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AttentionLayer.html">transformers</a>” that get applied with certain weights to more distant pixels. Schematically in <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/language/">Wolfram Language</a> the <a href="https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/StableDiffusionSynthesize/">network looks at a high level like this</a>:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img11.png" alt="" title="" width="594" height="278"> </p>
</div>
<p>And roughly what it’s doing is to make an informationally compressed version of each image, and then to expand it again (through what is usually called a “U-net” neural net). We start with an untrained version of this network (say just randomly initialized). Then we feed it a couple of million examples of noisy pictures of <img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png" alt="" width="11" height=" "> and <img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/B2helvetica.png" alt="" width="11" height=" ">, and the denoised outputs we want in each case. </p>
<p>Then if we take the trained neural net and successively apply it, for example, to a “noised <img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png" alt="" width="11" height=" ">”, the net will “correctly” determine that the “denoised” version is a “pure <img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png" alt="" width="11" height=" ">”:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img12.png" alt="" title="" width="370" height="28"> </p>
</div>
<p>But what if we apply this network to pure noise? The network has been set up to always eventually evolve either to the “<img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png" alt="" width="11" height=" ">” attractor or the “<img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/B2helvetica.png" alt="" width="11" height=" ">” attractor. But which it “chooses” in a particular case will depend on the details of the initial noise—so in effect the network will seem to be picking at random to “fish” either “<img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png" alt="" width="11" height=" ">” or “<img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/B2helvetica.png" alt="" width="11" height=" ">” out of the noise:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img13.png" alt="" title="" width="572" height="164"> </p>
</div>
<p>How does this apply to our original goal of generating images “like” those found for example on the web? Well, instead of just training our “denoising” (or “inverse diffusion”) network on a couple of “target” images, let’s imagine we train it on billions of images from the web. And let’s also assume that our network isn’t big enough to store all those images in any kind of explicit way.</p>
<p>In the abstract it’s not clear what the network will do. But the remarkable empirical fact is that it seems to manage to successfully generate (“from noise”) images that “follow the general patterns” of the images it was trained from. There isn’t any clear way to “formally validate” this success. It’s really just a matter of human perception: to us the images (generally) “look right”. </p>
<p>It could be that with a different (alien?) <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis/">system of perception</a> we’d immediately see “something wrong” with the images. But for purposes of human perception, the neural net seems to give “reasonable-looking” images—perhaps not least because the neural net operates at least approximately like our brains and our processes of perception seem to operate. </p>
<h3 id="injecting-a-prompt">Injecting a Prompt</h3>
<p>We’ve described how a denoising neural net seems to be able to start from some configuration of random noise and generate a “reasonable-looking” image. And from any particular configuration of noise, a given neural net will always generate the same image. But there’s no way to tell what that image will be of; it’s just something to empirically explore, as we did above.</p>
<p>But what if we want to “guide” the neural net to generate an image that we’d describe as being of a definite thing, like “a cat in a party hat”? We could imagine “continually checking” whether the image we’re generating would be recognized by a neural net as being of what we wanted. And conceptually that’s what we can do. But we also need a way to “redirect” the image generation if it’s “not going in the right direction”. And a convenient way to do this is to mix a “description of what we want” right into the denoising training process. In particular, if we’re training to “recover an <img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png" alt="" width="11" height=" ">”, mix a description of the “<img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png" alt="" width="11" height=" ">” right alongside the image of the “<img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png" alt="" width="11" height=" ">”.</p>
<p>And here we can make use of a key feature of neural nets: that ultimately they operate on arrays of (real) numbers. So whether they’re dealing with images composed of pixels, or text composed of words, all these things eventually have to be “ground up” into arrays of real numbers. And when a neural net is trained, what it’s ultimately “learning” is just how to appropriately transform these “disembodied” arrays of numbers. </p>
<p>There’s a fairly natural way to generate an array of numbers from an image: just take the triples of red, green and blue intensity values for each pixel. (Yes, we could pick a different detailed representation, but it’s not likely to matter—because the neural net can always effectively “learn a conversion”.) But what about a textual description, like “a cat in a party hat”?</p>
<p>We need to find a way to encode text as an array of numbers. And actually LLMs face the same issue, and we can solve it in basically <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#the-concept-of-embeddings">the same way here as LLMs do</a>. In the end what we want is to derive from any piece of text a “feature vector” consisting of an array of numbers that provide some kind of representation of the “effective meaning” of the text, or at least the “effective meaning” relevant to describing images. </p>
<p>Let’s say we train a neural net to reproduce associations between images and captions, as found for example on the web. If we feed this neural net an image, it’ll try to generate a caption for the image. If we feed the neural net a caption, it’s not realistic for it to generate a whole image. But we can look at the innards of the neural net and see the array of numbers it derived from the caption—and then use this as our feature vector. And the idea is that because captions that “mean the same thing” should be associated in the training set with “the same kind of images”, they should have similar feature vectors. </p>
<p>So now let’s say we want to generate a picture of a cat in a party hat. First we find the feature vector associated with the text “a cat in a party hat”. Then this is what we keep mixing in at each stage of denoising to guide the denoising process, and end up with an image that the image captioning network will identify as “a cat in a party hat”.</p>
<h3 id="the-latent-space-“trick”">The Latent Space “Trick”</h3>
<p>The most direct way to do “denoising” is to operate directly on the pixels in an image. But it turns out there’s a considerably more efficient approach, which operates not on pixels but on “features” of the image—or, more specifically, on a feature vector which describes an image. </p>
<p>In a “raw image” presented in terms of pixels, there’s a lot of redundancy—which is why, for example, image formats like JPEG and PNG manage to compress raw images so much without even noticeably modifying them for purposes of typical human perception. But with neural nets it’s possible to do much greater compression, particularly if all we want to do is to preserve the “meaning” of an image, without worrying about its precise details.</p>
<p>And in fact as part of training a neural net to associate images with captions, we can derive a “latent representation” of images, or in effect a feature vector that captures the “important features” of the image. And then we can do everything we’ve discussed so far directly on this latent representation—decoding it only at the end into the actual pixel representation of the image.</p>
<p>So what does it look like to build up the latent representation of an image? With the particular setup we’re using here, it turns out that the feature vector in the latent representation still preserves the basic spatial arrangement of the image. The “latent pixels” are much coarser than the “visible” ones, and happen to be characterized by 4 numbers rather than the 3 for RGB. But we can decode things to see the “denoising” process happening in terms of “latent pixels”:</p>

</div>
<p>And then we can take the latent representation we get, and once again use a trained neural net to fill in a “decoding” of this in terms of actual pixels, getting out our final generated image.</p>
<h2 id="an-analogy-in-simple-programs">An Analogy in Simple Programs</h2>
<p>Generative AI systems work by having attractors that are carefully constructed through training so that they correspond to “reasonable outputs”. A large part of what we’ve done above is to study what happens to these attractors when we change the internal parameters of the system (neural net weights, etc.). What we’ve seen has been complicated, and, indeed, often quite “alien looking”. But is there perhaps a simpler setup in which we can see similar core phenomena?</p>
<p>By the time we’re thinking about creating attractors for realistic images, etc. it’s inevitable that things are going to be complicated. But what if we look at systems with much simpler setups? For example, consider a dynamical system whose state is characterized just by a single number—such as an iterated map on the interval, like <em>x</em> <img title="" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123rightarrow.png" alt="" width="16" height=" "> <em>a</em> <em>x</em> (1 – <em>x</em>).</p>
<p>Starting from a uniform array of possible <em>x</em> values, we can show down the page which values of <em>x</em> are achieved at successive iterations:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img1.png" alt="" title="" width="613" height="180"> </p>
</div>
<p>For <em>a</em> = 2.9, the system evolves from any initial value to a single attractor, which consists of a single fixed final value. But if we change the “internal parameter” <em>a</em> to 3.1, we now get two distinct final values. And at the “bifurcation point” <em>a</em> = 3 there’s a sudden change from one to two distinct final values. And indeed in our generative AI system it’s fairly common to see similar discontinuous changes in behavior even when an internal parameter is continuously changed.</p>
<p>As another example—slightly closer to image generation—consider (as above) a 1D cellular automaton that exhibits class 2 behavior, and evolves from any initial state to some fixed final state that one can think of as an attractor for the system:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img2.png" alt="" title="" width="575" height="148"> </p>
</div>
<p>Which attractor one reaches depends on the initial condition one starts from. But—in analogy to our generative AI system—we can think of all the attractors as being “reasonable outputs” for the system. But now what happens if we change the parameters of the system, or in this case, the cellular automaton rule? In particular, what will happen to the attractors? It’s like what we did above in changing weights in a neural net—but a lot simpler.</p>
<p>The particular rule we’re using here has 4 possible colors for each cell, and is defined by just 64 discrete values from 0 to 3. So let’s say we randomly change just one of those values at a time. Here are some examples of what we get, always starting from the same initial condition as in the first picture above: </p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img3.png" alt="" title="" width="596" height="285"> </p>
</div>
<p>With a couple of exceptions these seem to produce results that are at least “roughly similar” to what we got without changing the rule. In analogy to what we did above, the cat might have changed, but it’s still more or less a cat. But let’s now try “progressive randomization”, where we modify successively more values in the definition of the rule. For a while we again get “roughly similar” results, but then—much like in our cat examples above—things eventually “fall apart” and we get “much more random” results:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img4.png" alt="" title="" width="596" height="285"> </p>
</div>
<p>One important difference between “stable diffusion” and cellular automata is that while in cellular automata, the evolution can lead to continued change forever, in stable diffusion there’s an annealing process used that always makes successive steps “progressively smaller”—and essentially forces a fixed point to be reached.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding this, we can try to get a closer analogy to image generation by looking (again as above) at 2D cellular automata. Here’s an example of the (not-too-exciting-as-images) “final states” reached from three different initial states in a particular rule:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img5.png" alt="" title="" width="573" height="181"> </p>
</div>
<p>And here’s what happens if one progressively changes the rule:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img6.png" alt="" title="" width="594" height="229"> </p>
</div>
<p>At first one still gets “reasonable-according-to-the-original-rule” final states. But if one changes the rule further, things get “more alien”, until they look to us quite random. </p>
<p>In changing the rule, one is in effect “<a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/#motion-in-rulial-space">moving in rulial space</a>”. And by looking at how this works in cellular automata, one can get a certain amount of intuition. (<a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p391--fundamental-issues-in-biology/">Changes to the rule</a> in a cellular automaton seem a bit like “changes to the genotype” in biology—with the behavior of the cellular automaton representing the corresponding “phenotype”.) But seeing how “rulial motion” works in a generative AI that’s been trained on “human-style input” gives a more accessible and humanized picture of what’s going on, even if it seems still further out of reach in terms of any kind of traditional explicit formalization.</p>
