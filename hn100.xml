		<p><span>NYC subway crime has dropped significantly so far this year even as ridership increased in <a href="https://www.amny.com/?s=congestion+pricing">the congestion pricing era</a>, according to the newest <a href="http://nyc.gov/nypd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYPD</a> data released on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span>In the first month of 2025, there were 147 reported crimes on the subway down from 231 last year—resulting in 36% fewer crimes committed on the rails this year.</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, subway ridership has increased significantly since the start of congestion pricing on Jan. 5. This means that the drop in crime on the tracks has actually decreased even as more people are using NYC’s busy transit system—one of the largest in the world.</span></p>

<p><span>According to </span><a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Daily-Ridership-Data-2020-2025/vxuj-8kew/about_data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>data on the New York State website</span></a><span>, subway ridership has increased almost every day since congestion pricing began on Jan. 5 — often in the hundreds of thousands of additional commuters daily.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, on Jan. 8, the first Wednesday with congestion pricing in effect this year, over 530,000 more people were on the trains than the same day last year (3,834,806 vs. 3,303,727).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Between Jan. 6 and 28, an amNewYork Metro review of MTA data found, ridership was up more than 9.1 million commuters year-over-year (74,680,439 in 2025 vs. 65,569,613 in 2024), a 13.1% increase.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Traffic fatalities across the city are also down, the<a href="https://compstat.nypdonline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> NYPD’s CompStat 2.0 dashboard</a> shows.

<p><span>The MTA, the state agency that runs the NYC trains and buses, had long touted that congestion pricing would bring more New Yorkers onto mass transit, thus relieving heavy traffic build up in Midtown and Lower Manhattan. So far, those predictions are being proven true.</span></p>

</p><h2>More cops = more safety in subways, mayor says</h2>
<p><span>Mayor Eric Adams attributed the decline in subway crime to a number of factors, including the massive surge of 1,200 additional NYPD officers in the subway system, as well as an additional 300 officers patrolling overnight trains.</span></p>

<p><span>“Public safety is the prerequisite to prosperity, and the latest crime statistics for January prove that our comprehensive approach to combating crime and improving quality of life is not only working, it’s driving real, measurable progress,” the mayor said in a statement to amNewYork Metro. “We’re seeing double-digit decreases in both overall crime above ground and transit crime below ground – with shooting incidents in January being the lowest number recorded for the month of January in over 30 years – and we remain committed to ensuring that New Yorkers aren’t just safe but feel safe, too.”</span></p>
<p><span>Transit crime was down throughout much of 2024, but Mayor Adams, the MTA and the NYPD have been battling public perception that subway crime was out of control – largely fueled by widely-reported, high-profile crimes on the trains</span><span>, including the </span><a href="https://www.amny.com/news/woman-burned-brooklyn-subway-arson-identified/"><span>horrific arson homicide </span></a><span>when a woman was burned alive on an F train in Coney Island.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The mayor added that the additional law enforcement efforts to prevent crime underground provide a “visible and effective presence” that makes commuters “both safer and more confident.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I want to thank Commissioner Tisch and the incredible men and women of the NYPD for making our streets safer every day,” Adams added. “While others advocate for defunding the police, we’ve defended them, and this is just one of countless examples of why New Yorkers want more policing, not less.”</span></p>
<p><span>This year’s decrease in crime so far points to a sign that city and state officials might be making progress in addressing the challenges facing the subway system, something which Gov. Kathy Hochul responded to when she announced a $77 million initiative on Jan. 16 to have </span><a href="https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-subway-safety-hochul-cops-overnight-trains/"><span>more uniformed police officers</span></a><span> on every overnight train.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Last year, she also directed the MTA to install over 15,000 cameras in every subway car and added about 1,250 National Guard members alongside police to assist in patrolling the mostly underground transit system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Governor Hochul is committed to ensuring that every rider and worker feels safe when they enter our transit system and are on the subway,” said Matthew Janiszewski, a spokesperson for the governor. “Governor Hochul is working hand-in-hand with the MTA and New York City to deter crime, making it safer for all riders and restoring public confidence in the system.”</span></p>
<p><span>NYC Transit President Demetrius Crichlow underscored the importance of law enforcement of public transit.</span>
</p><p><span>“Every survey shows New Yorkers want more uniformed officers on trains, and this is why. With Governor Hochul’s funding and NYPD deployment on every train overnight, crime is down, and riders are increasingly using transit to get where they need to go,” he said. “That’s no coincidence.”</span></p>

        <p>The human brain may contain up to a spoon’s worth of tiny plastic shards—not a spoonful, but the same weight (about seven grams) as a plastic spoon, according to new findings published Monday in the journal <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1"><em>Nature Medicine</em></a></em>.</p>

<p>Researchers detected these “almost unbelievable” levels of microplastics and nanoplastics in the brains of human cadavers, says study co-author <a href="https://www.neuro.duke.edu/profile/andrew-bradley-west">Andrew West</a>, a neuroscientist at Duke University, to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastic-human-brains-microplastics"><em>Science</em><em> </em><em>News</em></a>’ Laura Sanders. “In fact, I didn’t believe it until I saw all the data.”</p>

<p>Based on their analysis, the amount of microplastics in the human brain appears to be increasing over time: Concentrations rose by roughly 50 percent between 2016 and 2024.</p>

<p>The researchers also found much higher levels of microplastics in brain tissue than in liver and kidney tissue. And microplastic concentrations were also higher in the brains of deceased patients who had been diagnosed with <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/us-dementia-cases-are-poised-to-rise-to-one-million-each-year-by-2060-according-to-new-projections-180985831/">dementia</a> compared to the brains of deceased individuals without dementia.</p>

<p>Importantly, the study finds only a correlation between high levels of microplastics in the brain and dementia—it does not establish a causal relationship. It could be, for instance, that changes resulting from dementia make it easier for microplastics to accumulate in the brain. However, the researchers say their findings are troubling nonetheless.</p>

<p>“I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, ‘There’s a bunch of plastic in my brain and I’m totally cool with that,’” says study co-author <a href="https://hsc.unm.edu/directory/campen-matthew-j.html">Matthew Campen</a>, a toxicologist at the University of New Mexico, in a <a href="https://hsc.unm.edu/news/2025/02/hsc-newsroom-post-microplastics-human-brains.html">statement</a>.</p>

<p>Microplastics and nanoplastics are miniscule plastic fragments that result from the breakdown of everyday objects like packaging, containers, clothing, tires and more. These small particles have spread all over the planet, from <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/even-mount-everest-facing-microplastic-pollution-new-study-finds-180976389/">Mount Everest</a> to deep in the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-shows-deepest-parts-ocean-are-polluted-plastic-180969049/">Mariana Trench</a>. They’ve also made their way into the human body, showing up in <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/microplastics-detected-in-human-blood-180979826/">blood</a>, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-shows-infant-poop-is-riddled-with-microplastics-180978770/">baby poop</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/22/microplastics-revealed-in-placentas-unborn-babies">lungs</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/22/microplastics-revealed-in-placentas-unborn-babies">placentas</a>.</p>

<p>In September 2024, these miniature pollutants were also discovered in the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-find-microplastics-in-human-brain-tissue-above-the-nose-180985100/">human olfactory bulb</a>, a type of brain tissue that sits above the nose in the forebrain. At the time, researchers weren’t completely sure whether microplastics could migrate deeper into the brain.</p>

<p>The new paper suggests they can. First, researchers analyzed brain, kidney and liver tissue from patients who had died in 2016 and 2024. For broader context, they also studied brain tissue from patients who had died between 1997 and 2013. Some of the brains came from patients who had been diagnosed with dementia.</p>

<p>They found much higher levels of microplastics in the 2024 brain tissue, on average, than in the 2016 brain tissue, regardless of the patient’s age, sex, race, ethnicity or cause of death. Their findings suggest microplastic levels in the brain have grown by roughly 50 percent over the last eight years. This increase makes sense in the context of plastic production, which doubles every 10 to 15 years, reports the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/02/03/microplastics-human-brain-increase/"><em>Washington Post</em></a>’s Shannon Osaka.</p>

<p>“We think [the increase] is simply mirroring the environmental buildup and exposure,” Campen tells <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/microplastic-human-brain-health?loggedin=true&amp;rnd=1738686119003"><em>National Geographic</em></a>’s Olivia Ferrari. “People are being exposed to ever-increasing levels of micro and nanoplastics.”</p>

<p>Microplastic levels were 7 to 30 times higher in the examined brain tissue than in the liver and kidney tissue.</p>

<p>Microplastic concentrations were also three to five times higher in the brains of patients with dementia, compared to cognitively normal brains. It’s not clear whether microplastics may cause or contribute to dementia, nor whether dementia-induced changes to the brain might allow more microplastics to enter.</p>

<p>More broadly, the potential health consequences of microplastics remain largely unknown. Some recent research, however, suggests they are likely harmful to the human body. A <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822">study</a> published in March 2024, for example, found that patients with higher concentrations of microplastics in their arteries were at a higher risk of heart attacks, stroke and death.</p>

<p>Now that microplastics have been found deep in the human brain, the next steps will be to explore what effects, if any, they are having on human health.</p>

<p>Future studies might also investigate how microplastics and nanoplastics are making their way into the brain in the first place, a feat that remains a mystery. Researchers are also curious about the unusual shapes of the plastic particles they found in the brain: thin, sharp shards, rather than the smooth, bead-like shapes they had expected.</p>

<p>“Somehow, these nanoplastics hijack their way through the body and get to the brain, crossing the blood-brain barrier,” Campen tells <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/health/plastics-inside-human-brain-wellness/index.html">CNN</a>’s Sandee LaMotte. “Plastics love fats, or lipids, so one theory is that plastics are hijacking their way with the fats we eat, which are then delivered to the organs that really like lipids—the brain is top among those.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, the world might want to consider “mitigation measures” to help minimize microplastic exposure, says <a href="https://www.uu.nl/staff/EEJkasteel">Emma Kasteel</a>, a neurotoxicologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands who was not involved with the paper, to <em>National Geographic</em>.</p>

<p>“We don’t know that much about the health effects, but the fact is that [microplastics] are [in the brain] and they shouldn’t be there, and maybe that’s worrying enough,” she says.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://idiallo.com/blog/listen-mp3-is-free">https://idiallo.com/blog/listen-mp3-is-free</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42957517">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="articleBody">
	

<p>The MP3 format, once the gold standard for digital audio files, is now free. The licensing and patents on MP3 encoders have expired, meaning you can now include them in your applications without paying royalties. For software developers and audio enthusiasts, this might seem like a big deal. But, surprisingly, almost no one noticed. Why? Because the world of technology has changed so drastically that MP3's significance has faded into the background.</p>

<p>I noticed the change because of <a href="https://idiallo.com/blog/mp3-is-free-september-2015">my habit of downloading Audacity</a>, the open-source audio editing software. For years, Audacity required users to download an external MP3 encoder, like LAME, because the MP3 format was proprietary. This extra step was a constant reminder of the legal and technical restrictions surrounding MP3. But now, that step is unnecessary. And yet, no one seems to care.  </p>

<p>The reality is that MP3, while still relevant in certain niche areas, has largely been eclipsed by a combination of faster internet speeds, changing software paradigms, and a shift away from dealing with files altogether.  </p>

<h2>Files? What Files?</h2>

<p>One of the biggest shifts in recent years has been the abstraction of what a file even is. Twenty years ago, the average computer user dealt with files constantly. Downloading, organizing, and moving them between devices. Music files were downloaded as MP3s and carefully sorted into folders. Today, most people interact with music through streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, or YouTube. They don’t download files, nor do they think about what format their music is in.  </p>

<p>This is part of a broader trend where the cloud has replaced local storage for many users. We stream music and movies instead of downloading them. We work on Google Docs instead of saving Word files to our desktop. Files, for the general population, are becoming an invisible concept.  </p>

<h2>Internet Speeds Make File Sizes Invisible</h2>

<p>Back in the early 2000s, an MP3 file, typically around 3.5MB, was considered small. But downloading one still took time, minutes on a standard internet connection. File size mattered. A smaller file meant quicker downloads and less space used on your limited storage.  </p>

<p>Fast forward to today, and internet speeds have grown exponentially. A song in a more modern format like AAC or FLAC might be double or triple the size of an MP3, but who notices? You can stream a full album in lossless quality without buffering. Kids download gigabyte-sized games in minutes.  </p>

<p>The average person no longer pays attention to file sizes. Terms like megabyte or kilobyte, which were once part of everyday tech conversations, are now arcane to many users. When everything happens instantly, file size ceases to be a concern.</p>





<h2>What Does It Mean That MP3 Is Free?</h2>

<p>The expiration of MP3’s licensing fees is still a significant milestone, particularly for developers or those working in niche areas like archival or specialized audio tools. It means tools like Audacity can now integrate MP3 support without extra steps, and developers of new software can include MP3 compatibility freely.  </p>

<p>However, for the general population, this change is almost irrelevant. MP3 is no longer a bottleneck for audio distribution. Streaming platforms, cloud-based solutions, and better internet infrastructure have made the need for small, efficient file formats like MP3 far less critical.  </p>

<h2>The Changing Landscape</h2>

<p>The MP3’s journey from revolutionary to nearly forgotten reflects how technology evolves and reshapes user behavior. While it was once essential for making audio accessible in the early days of the internet, today it’s just one of many tools in the vast ecosystem of digital media.  </p>

<p>But even if most people didn’t notice that MP3 is now free, it’s worth pausing to appreciate its legacy. It’s a reminder of how far we’ve come, and how the things that once seemed indispensable can quietly fade into the background as the world changes around them.  </p>

<p>MP3 being free is a milestone worth noting, even if its relevance has diminished. After all, it’s not every day that a format that defined a generation of music lovers becomes a footnote in the history of technology.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Imagine if it had gone like this.  </p><p>Ten Tesla cybertrucks, painted in camouflage colors with a giant X on each roof, drive noisily through Washington DC.  Tires screech.  Out jump a couple of dozen young men, dressed in red and black Devil’s Champion armored costumes.  After giving Nazi salutes, they grab guns and run to one government departmental after another, calling out slogans like “all power to Supreme Leader Skibidi Hitler.”</p><p>Historically, that is what coups looked like.  The center of power was a physical place.  Occupying it, and driving out the people who held office, was to claim control.  So if a cohort of armed men with odd symbols had stormed government buildings, Americans would have recognized that as a coup attempt. </p><p>And that sort of coup attempt would have failed.  </p><p>Now imagine that, instead, the scene goes like this.</p><p>A couple dozen young men go from government office to government office, dressed in civilian clothes and armed only with zip drives.  Using technical jargon and vague references to orders from on high, they gain access to the basic computer systems of the federal government.  Having done so, they proceed to grant their Supreme Leader access to information and the power to start and stop all government payments.</p><p>That coup is, in fact, happening.  And if we do not recognize it for what it is, it could succeed.</p><p>In the third decade of the twenty first century, power is more digital than physical.  The buildings and the human beings are there to protect the workings of the computers, and thus the workings of the government as a whole, in our case an (in principle) democratic government which is organized and bounded by a notion of individual rights.</p><p>The ongoing actions by Musk and his followers are a coup because the individuals seizing power have no right to it.  Elon Musk was elected to no office and there is no office that would give him the authority to do what he is doing.  It is all illegal.  It is also a coup in its intended effects: to undo democratic practice and violate human rights.  </p><p>In gaining data about us all, Musk has trampled on any notion of privacy and dignity, as well as on the explicit and implicit agreements made with our government when we pay our taxes or our student loans.  And the possession of that data enables blackmail and further crimes.</p><p><span>In gaining the ability to stop payments by the Department of the </span><a href="https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/" rel="">Treasury</a><span>, Musk would also make democracy meaningless.  We vote for representatives in Congress, who pass laws that determine how our tax money is spent.  If Musk has the power to halt this process at the level of payment, he can make laws meaningless.  Which means, in turn, that Congress is meaningless, and our votes are meaningless, as is our citizenship.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1597201749396-99a6b0537704?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxjYXBpdG9sfGVufDB8fHx8MTczODcxMDc2MHww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1597201749396-99a6b0537704?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxjYXBpdG9sfGVufDB8fHx8MTczODcxMDc2MHww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 424w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1597201749396-99a6b0537704?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxjYXBpdG9sfGVufDB8fHx8MTczODcxMDc2MHww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 848w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1597201749396-99a6b0537704?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxjYXBpdG9sfGVufDB8fHx8MTczODcxMDc2MHww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 1272w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1597201749396-99a6b0537704?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxjYXBpdG9sfGVufDB8fHx8MTczODcxMDc2MHww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1597201749396-99a6b0537704?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxjYXBpdG9sfGVufDB8fHx8MTczODcxMDc2MHww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" width="292" height="194.66666666666666" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1597201749396-99a6b0537704?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxjYXBpdG9sfGVufDB8fHx8MTczODcxMDc2MHww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2200,&quot;width&quot;:3300,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:292,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;grayscale photo of dome building&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="grayscale photo of dome building" title="grayscale photo of dome building" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1597201749396-99a6b0537704?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxjYXBpdG9sfGVufDB8fHx8MTczODcxMDc2MHww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 424w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1597201749396-99a6b0537704?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxjYXBpdG9sfGVufDB8fHx8MTczODcxMDc2MHww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 848w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1597201749396-99a6b0537704?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxjYXBpdG9sfGVufDB8fHx8MTczODcxMDc2MHww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 1272w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1597201749396-99a6b0537704?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxjYXBpdG9sfGVufDB8fHx8MTczODcxMDc2MHww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Resistance to the coup is the defense of the human against the digital and the democratic against the oligarchic.

  <p>Hello there! If you follow tech news, you might have heard about the <a href="https://trust.okta.com/security-advisories/okta-ad-ldap-delegated-authentication-username/" target="_blank">Okta security incident</a> that was reported on 1st of November. The TLDR of the incident was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bcrypt algorithm was used to generate the cache key where we hash a  combined string of userId + username + password. Under a specific set of conditions, listed below, this could allow users to authenticate by  providing the username with the stored cache key of a previous  successful authentication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that if the user had a username above 52 chars, any password would suffice to log in. Also, if the username is, let’s say, 50 chars long, it means that the bad actor needs to guess only 3 first chars to get in, which is quite a trivial task for the computers these days. Too bad, isn’t it?</p>
<p>On the other hand, such long usernames are not very usual, which I agree with. However, some companies like using the entire name of the employee as the email address. So, let’s say, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, a headmaster of Hogwarts, should be concerned, as <code><a href="https://n0rdy.foo/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7514191700065b051007161c0314195b02001913071c165b17071c141b5b110018171910111a0710351d1a1202140701065b06161d1a1a19">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> is 55 chars. Ooops!</p>
<p><img src="https://n0rdy.foo/images/drawings/20250122-0001.webp" alt="image"></p>
<p>This was possible due to the nature of Bcrypt hashing algorithm that has a maximum supported input length of 72 characters (read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Maximum_password_length" target="_blank">here</a>), so in Okta case the characters above the limit were ignored while computing the hash, and therefore, not used in the comparison operation. We can reverse engineer that:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>72 - 53 = 19</code> - user id with separators if any</li>
<li>this way, the password will be outside the 72 chars limit, and, therefore, ignored by the Bcrypt algorithm</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there was one thing that made me wonder: if there is a known limit of the algorithm, why is it not enforced by the crypto libraries as a form of input validation? A simple <code>if input length &gt; 72 -&gt; return error</code> will do the trick. I assumed that they might have used some custom library for Bcrypt implementation and simply forgotten about the input validation, which can happen. So, I decided to check how other programming languages behave.</p>
<h2 id="go-and-bcrypt">Go and Bcrypt</h2>
<p>Let’s start with Go, and implement the Okta incident-like case with the help of the official <code>golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt</code> library:</p>

</span></span><span><span>	}

</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>All the code samples can be found <a href="https://github.com/n0rdy/n0rdy-blog-code-samples/tree/main/20250122-bcrypt-api" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>What this code does is:</p>
<ul>
<li>generates 18-chars long userId</li>
<li>generates 55-chars long username</li>
<li>concatenates them with each other and a dummy password <code>super-duper-secure-password</code> with the use of <code>:</code> as a separator</li>
<li>computes Bcrypt hash from the concatenated string</li>
<li>then concatenates the same userId and username with a different password <code>wrong-password</code></li>
<li>uses bcrypt API to compare whether the 2nd concatenated string matches the hash of the 1st one</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s run the code and see the result:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plain"><span><span>panic: bcrypt: password length exceeds 72 bytes
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>goroutine 1 [running]:
</span></span><span><span>main.main()
</span></span><span><span>	/n0rdy-blog-code-samples/20250121-bcrypt-api/01-bcrypt-in-go/main.go:20 +0x2d1
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Good job, Go! If we check the source code of the <code>bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword(...)</code> function, we’ll see this piece of code at the very beginning:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>if</span> len(<span>password</span>) &gt; <span>72</span> {
</span></span><span><span>	<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>, <span>ErrPasswordTooLong</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Perfect! At this point, I became even more suspicious about the tool Okta used, as it seemed like the industry figured that out based on this example. Spoiler alert: it’s not that simple.</p>
<p>Let’s proceed with Java.</p>

<h2 id="java-and-bcrypt">Java and Bcrypt</h2>
<p>Java doesn’t support Bcrypt from its core API, but my simple Google search showed that Spring Security library has implemented it. For those who are not into Java ecosystem, Spring is the most used and battle-tested frameworks out there, that has libraries for almost anything: Web, DBs, Cloud, Security, AI, etc. Pretty powerful tool, that I’ve used a lot in the past, and still sometimes use for my side projects.</p>
<h3 id="spring-security">Spring Security</h3>
<p>So, I added the latest version of Spring Security to the project and reproduced the same scenario, as in Go example above:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>import</span> org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils;
</span></span><span><span><span>import</span> org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCrypt;

</span></span><span><span>        <span>// 18 + 55 + 1 = 74, so above 72 characters' limit of BCrypt</span>

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>var</span> combinedHash <span>=</span> BCrypt.<span>hashpw</span>(combinedString, BCrypt.<span>gensalt</span>());
</span></span><span><span>

</span></span><span><span>        <span>var</span> wrongPassword <span>=</span> <span>"wrong-password"</span>;
</span></span><span><span>        <span>var</span> wrongCombinedString <span>=</span> String.<span>format</span>(<span>"%s:%s:%s"</span>, userId, username, wrongPassword);
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>if</span> (BCrypt.<span>checkpw</span>(wrongCombinedString, combinedHash)) {
</span></span><span><span>            System.<span>out</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>"Password is correct"</span>);
</span></span><span><span>        } <span>else</span> {
</span></span><span><span>            System.<span>out</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>"Password is incorrect"</span>);
</span></span><span><span>        }
</span></span><span><span>    }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I ran the code, and to my great surprise, saw this outcome:</p>
<p>I took a peak at the implementation code, and was disappointed: even though there are a bunch of checks on salt:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>if (saltLength &lt; 28) {
	throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid salt");
}
...
if (salt.charAt(0) != '$' || salt.charAt(1) != '2') {
	throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid salt version");
}
...
minor = salt.charAt(2);
if ((minor != 'a' &amp;&amp; minor != 'x' &amp;&amp; minor != 'y' &amp;&amp; minor != 'b') || salt.charAt(3) != '$') {
	throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid salt revision");
}
...
</code></pre><p>I didn’t see any validation of the input that will be hashed. Hm…</p>
<p>I decided to check other Google results, and the next Java library in the list was <code>bcrypt</code> from Patrick Favre (<a href="https://github.com/patrickfav/bcrypt" target="_blank">link to GitHub repo</a>) with 513 starts and the last release version 0.10.2 (so, not stable) from 12th of February 2023 (almost 2 years old). This suggested that I’d not use it in production, but why not to run our tests.</p>

<p>Many implementations of bcrypt truncate the password to the first 72 bytes, following the OpenBSD implementation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting! Let’s check the OpenBSD implementation of this algorithm, and <a href="https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/master/lib/libc/crypt/bcrypt.c" target="_blank">here is the link</a> to it. The first point of interest lies here:</p>

<p>Let me start with a short disclaimer: I have a huge respect for people who spend their free time and mental capacity on maintaining open-source projects. That’s a large amount of work, that is not paid, and, unfortunately, quite often not appreciated by the users of the tools. That’s why they have all the legal and ethical rights to build the project the way they see them. My opinions below are not targeted towards anyone in particular.</p>
<p>My initial goal was to create issues for each of the mentioned library, but I noticed that this behavior has been already reported to each of them:</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-and-lessons">Thoughts and lessons</h3>
<p>As a guy who spent a few years of my career on building tools and solutions to be used by other software engineers, I understand the frustration: you invested your time and effort into writing a clear documentation and guides, but a certain number of your users don’t bother checking it at all, and just use the tool the way they think it should be used. However, that’s the reality that I had to accept and started thinking about how can I make my tools handle those use cases. Here are a few principles I came up with in that process.</p>
<h4 id="dont-let-the-people-use-your-api-incorrectly">Don’t let the people use your API incorrectly</h4>
<p>In my opinion, from the API perspective, the approach when the tool silently cuts the part of the input and processes the remaining one only, it is an extremely poor design choice. What makes things worse is the fact that Bcrypt is used in the domain of security and sensitive data, and, as we can see, most of the tools mentioned above, use <code>password</code> as the name of the input parameter of the hashing method. <strong>The good design should explicitly reject the invalid input</strong> with the error / exception / any other mechanism the platform uses. So, basically, exactly what Go and Patrick’s Java library did. This way, incidents like Okta one would be impossible by design (btw, I’m not shifting the blame away from Okta, considering the domain they operate in).</p>
<p>It is ok, though, to offer the non-default unsafe option, that will let the users pass longer input that will be truncated if the user explicitly asks for that. A prefix/suffix like <code>unsafe</code>, <code>truncated</code>, etc. can be a good addition to the names of the method that expose these options.</p>
<h4 id="be-predictable">Be predictable</h4>
<p>If we take a step back from the Bcrypt case, imagine other examples, if such a pattern becomes common in the industry:</p>
<ul>
<li>We created a new user account on HBO to watch a new season of Rick and Morty, and there is a warning that the max size of the password should not exceed 18 chars. However, the password generator of your password manager tool uses 25 chars as a default length of the produced password. So, the password manager inserts that password while creating an account, but the server cuts the last 7 chars, hashes the rest, and saves the hash to the DB. How easy would it be for us to be able to log in to HBO next time and watch a new episode?</li>
<li>The tech lead of the new project configured a linter tool, and set the max line length as 100 chars. While performing a check, linter removes the chars above the defined limit, and informs that the check has passed. How useful would it be?</li>
</ul>
<p>A good API design should remember that when it comes to tech, nobody likes surprises.</p>
<h4 id="no-ego">No ego</h4>
<p>While following a few online discussions about the Bcrypt Okta incident, I noticed something else: while the majority of comments agreed that we should design APIs like these better, there were a few folks that took a very defensive stance and exposed their ego: “Read a paper before using anything!”, “APIs are only correcting the input after the stupid users!”, etc. Based on my experience, ego is a big enemy of engineering. And I wouldn’t be surprised if you have a story or two in that regard as well. So, yeah, let’s not bring our egos to our APIs.</p>
<h4 id="be-helpful">Be helpful</h4>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I do understand the gist that the users should have some basic knowledge before using any tool. But let’s get back to the reality: how many different tools, programming languages, databases, protocols, frameworks, libraries, algorithms, data structures, clouds, AI models, etc. does a software engineer use per week these days? I tried to count for my use case, but stopped after the number had reached 30. Is it possible to know all of them deep? To know all the edge cases and limits? For some of them and to some degree is a reasonable ask, as well as having an expertise in 1 or 2, but definitely not all. The hard truth is that on average, the industry today requires the wide spectrum of knowledge over the deep one (check any job opening to verify that claim). Therefore, while designing the tools, why not to help our fellow colleagues? For example, if our tool accepts only positive numbers, let’s add <code>if num &lt; 1 -&gt; return error</code>  to our solution, and make the life simpler for somebody out there.</p>
<p>Especially, if the tool might be used in the security-sensitive context, where humans are usually the weak point in the thread modelling. The good API can help there.</p>
<h4 id="be-brave">Be brave</h4>
<p>It’s not so often that the API we design is something completely new to the world. Most likely, there are other solutions like ours out there. And the chances are that they’ve been already doing certain things the particular way. However, that doesn’t mean that we need to follow the same path. Kudos to the Go team and Patrick’s Java library for being brave to do things the different way as the industry does in the Bcrypt example. Let’s learn from them.</p>
<h4 id="reiterate">Reiterate</h4>
<p>Regardless of the original design choices and intentions, it’s never too late to reiterate on some of them if we see a need or have discovered new information. That’s, actually, a place where a lot of us fail due to different reasons, with some of them listed above.</p>
<h2 id="instead-of-a-conclusion">Instead of a conclusion</h2>
<p>The Okta incident exposed large security issues out there. Our test showed, even 3 months after the incident, the industry is still vulnerable to the same outcome, so the chances are that more to come. However, we, as software engineers, can learn from that, and apply these lessons while designing APIs to make them predictable and easier to use.</p>
<p>I hope that was useful, and triggered some thoughts. Thanks a lot for reading my post, and see you in the following ones, there are plenty of topics to discuss. Have fun! =)</p>

            <p>In 2006, Ron Jeffries wrote a series of posts describing his attempts to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku" target="_blank">Sudoku</a> solver.  He <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/oksudoku/" target="_blank">began</a> by wrapping a class around a simple datatype for the board — essentially a <code>List[Option[Int]]</code> — and after that, there isn't much to tell.  As Peter Seibel puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[H]e basically wandered around for the rest of his five blog postings fiddling with the representation, making it more “object oriented” and then fixing up the tests to work with the new representation and so on until eventually, it seems, he just got bored and gave up, having made only one minor stab at the problem of actually solving puzzles.<sup id="fnref:seibel1"><a href="#fn:seibel1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story has, in some circles, become notorious.  There are two reasons for this.  The first is that Ron Jeffries is a leading proponent of a <a href="https://explaining.software/archive/the-death-of-the-architect/" target="_blank">post-design</a> approach to software development.  Good design, he asserts, is simply the result of keeping your code "properly-factored:"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Kent] Beck has those rules for properly-factored code: 1) runs all the tests, 2) contains no duplication, 3) expresses every idea you want to express, 4) minimal number of classes and methods. When you work with these rules, you pay attention only to micro-design matters.</p>
<p>When I used to watch Beck do this, I was sure he was really doing macro design "in his head" and just not talking about it, because you can see the design taking shape, but he never seems to be doing anything directed to the design. So I started trying it. What I experience is that I am never doing anything directed to macro design or architecture: just making small changes, removing duplication, improving the expressiveness of little patches of code. Yet the overall design of the system improves. I swear I'm not doing it.<sup id="fnref:jeffries1"><a href="#fn:jeffries1">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second reason is that, in the same week that Jeffries was wandering around, Peter Norvig released a <a href="https://norvig.com/sudoku.html" target="_blank">complete Sudoku solver</a>.  And in his first fifteen lines of code, he got further than Jeffries:</p>

             <span>for</span> <span>s</span> <span>in</span> <span>squares</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you compare both implementations, Norvig's is notable for its clarity and directness.  Even more notable is his chosen datatype.  When Jeffries chose <code>List[Option[Int]]</code>, he was clearly mimicking how a Sudoku board was rendered on a page: there are a 81 cells, and some of them have numbers.  In Norvig's code, however, the Sudoku board is represented as a collection of possible moves: <code>Map[Coord, Set[Int]]</code>.  </p>
<p>An empty board is a collection of full sets; each cell can be assigned any integer in <code>{1, ..., 9}</code>.  When a cell is assigned a number, its set is reduced to a singleton, and that number is removed from the sets of all its <code>peers</code>.  If, as a result, a peer set is reduced to a singleton, this process repeats.</p>
<p>After that, the only thing left was a simple recursive search.  At each step, a move was randomly selected from the available options.  If that move emptied one of the sets, that line of search was abandoned.  And if all the sets were reduced to singletons, then our search was over.</p>
<p>While Norvig didn't employ any heuristics in his search, they'd be easy to add.  A common strategy in Sudoku is looking for <a href="https://www.learn-sudoku.com/naked-pairs.html" target="_blank">naked pairs</a>: if two peers have the same two candidate values, then simply assign one to each.  To employ this, all you'd need to do is replace the random selection with a function that looks for matching 2-sets.</p>
<p>And so Norvig's implementation was more than a toy solution.  It was a minimal, but extensible, example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_consistency" target="_blank">constraint propagation</a>.  It provided a foundation for exploring both the problem and the solution.</p>
<hr>
<h2>what it all means</h2>
<p>Norvig, for his part, didn't assign any of this much importance.  When interviewed by Seibel, he said the key difference was that Jeffries "didn't know how to solve the problem."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually knew — from AI — that, well, there's this field of constraint propagation — I know how that works.  There's this field of recursive search — I know how that works.  And I could see, right from the start, you put these two together, and you could solve this Sudoku thing.  He didn't know that so he was sort of blundering in the dark even though all his code "worked" because he had all these test cases.<sup id="fnref:seibel2"><a href="#fn:seibel2">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree, but would take it a little further.  Both Norvig and Jeffries are <strong>genre programmers</strong>; they have spent most of their career solving a specific kind of problem.  And that problem, inevitably, lends itself to a particular kind of solution.</p>
<p>Peter Norvig's genre is search.  He literally <a href="https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">wrote the book</a> on good old-fashioned AI, where every problem is reduced — for better or worse — to a search problem.  </p>
<p>Ron Jeffries' genre is, as best I can tell, the database application.  Like the rest of the Agile Manifesto co-authors, he came up in an era where every business was seeking to "computerize" its processes.  This led to a decade's worth of applications consisting of a database, a thin layer of business logic, and an even thinner frontend.  </p>
<p>There is, in these applications, a close relationship between the database schema and user interface.  Consider the scaffolding provided by the Rails framework: you describe an entity, and it generates the code necessary to view and change those entities.  This is why Jeffries chose the <code>List[Option[Int]]</code> representation; it mimicked how a Sudoku board is presented to its user.</p>
<p>This choice is not remarked upon.  It is, to Jeffries, simply the obvious place to start.  And I'd imagine that in his professional career, this intuition served him well.  But his intuition was developed, and applied, within his chosen genre.  Here, he was doing something new; a mystery novelist trying his hand at fantasy.  But in the end, it was just a bunch of elves and dwarves in a stately manor, waiting for the wizard to tell them whodunnit.</p>
<p>Jeffries, it should be noted, also assigns little importance to this episode.  After weathering fifteen years of online discourse, he wrote this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did incremental design and development fail? I don’t think so. Certainly I was using an incremental approach, and certainly no product came out. Did the approach fail?</p>
<p>I don’t think so. I think I wasn’t having fun and just stopped working on the project.<sup id="fnref:jeffries2"><a href="#fn:jeffries2">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is belied, however, by the fact that he returned to Sudoku two years later, writing <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/categories/sudoku/" target="_blank">forty-five</a> new posts on the topic.  </p>
<p>By the end of the fifth post, Jeffries had a working Sudoku solver.  <em>But then he kept going.</em>  He continued to tinker with the solver for another two months and forty posts.  And in this prolonged epilogue, we can see the limits of his incremental approach to software design.</p>
<hr>
<h2>back in the saddle point</h2>
<p>Jeffries' second attempt at a Sudoku solver begins, predictably, with a <code>List[Option[Int]]</code> representation.  From there, he writes a function that calculates the possible values for an empty cell.  He writes a simple recursive search function, which always selects the first possible value for the first possible cell.  And with that, his solver was complete.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/articles/-x024/-z00/4/#Summary" target="_blank">solution</a> is, from a design perspective, serviceable.  It's fewer than a hundred lines, but because of his chosen representation, much of that is spent on integer arithmetic:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>used_numbers_in_sub_grid</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>position</span><span>):</span>
  <span>first_index_in_row</span> <span>=</span> <span>position</span> <span>//</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>line_size</span> <span>*</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>line_size</span>
  <span>offset_in_row</span> <span>=</span> <span>position</span> <span>%</span> <span>9</span> <span>//</span> <span>3</span> <span>*</span> <span>3</span>
  <span>first_index_in_sub_grid</span> <span>=</span> <span>first_index_in_row</span> <span>//</span> <span>27</span> <span>*</span> <span>27</span> <span>+</span> <span>offset_in_row</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>row</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>first_index_in_sub_grid</span><span>,</span> <span>first_index_in_sub_grid</span><span>+</span><span>27</span><span>,</span> <span>9</span><span>):</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>col</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>):</span>
      <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can contrast this with the (roughly) equivalent code in Norvig's implementation:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>cross</span><span>(</span><span>rs</span><span>,</span> <span>cs</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>rs</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>'ABC'</span><span>,</span><span>'DEF'</span><span>,</span><span>'GHI'</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>cs</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>'123'</span><span>,</span><span>'456'</span><span>,</span><span>'789'</span><span>)]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The difference lies in how each cell is represented.  In Jeffries' code, each cell is an integer, representing its index in the <code>List</code>.  Norvig's code, on the other hand, represents each cell as a string describing its row and column.  As a result, he doesn't need to fuss with modulo operators; he can simply use string concatenation.</p>
<p>This, by itself, is not an indictment of Jeffries' approach.  His software design is incremental; what matters is the destination.  As he explains in his twenty-third post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Naturally, I try to make good design decisions, not bad ones, although often enough the decisions I make do not pan out. (Yes, I hear you saying that makes your case for coming up with a solid design early, but no, it doesn’t. It makes mine: I don’t know enough to make a better decision.) So I try to make small decisions, simple decisions, decisions that will be easy to change when, not if, a better idea comes along.<sup id="fnref:jeffries3"><a href="#fn:jeffries3">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is, unfortunately, little evidence of this in the preceding posts.  After demonstrating a working solver, Jeffries spends the next six posts trying to "simplify" it.  He tinkers a bit with the integer arithmetic, and then hides it away in a separate class.</p>
<p>Then, in the twelfth post, things get interesting.  While debugging his implementation, he generates an analogue of Norvig's representation: rather than an <code>Option[Int]</code>, each cell is a <code>Set[Int]</code> of possible values.  And in the thirteenth post, he arrives at the notion of constraint propagation:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Suppose the puzzle contains, not just the current solution state, but also, for each of the 81 cells, the available values for that cell. So when we do our <code>new_puzzle_trying</code> method, we’d</li>
<li>Create a new puzzle that copied all those values … then</li>
<li>Assign our guess … and then</li>
<li>Recompute the available values for the position’s components, which</li>
<li>Can be done either by removing the guess or recalculating, whichever is better.<sup id="fnref:jeffries4"><a href="#fn:jeffries4">6</a></sup></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a pivotal point in Jeffries' design process.  He has solved the problem, understood the limitations of that solution, and imagined something entirely different.  It is, in other words, a chance to start over.</p>
<p>If Jeffries started with a different core representation, then it's likely his subsequent design decisions would also change.  The bookkeeping for constraint propagation might push him towards Norvig's relational approach to the rules of Sudoku; rather than continually recomputing the rows, columns, and boxes, he could simply have a map of each cell onto its <code>peers</code>.  He could distill every lesson of the previous posts, creating something simpler and faster.</p>
<p>But Jeffries isn't in the business of starting over.  He not only believes in incremental design, but in using the smallest possible increments.  In his posts, he regularly returns to GeePaw Hill's maxim of <a href="https://www.geepawhill.org/2021/09/29/many-more-much-smaller-steps-first-sketch/" target="_blank">"many more much smaller steps."</a>  He is only interested in designs that are reachable through a series of small, discrete steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In most every article of the 5,000 articles here, at least the programming ones, I have intentionally done minimal design up front. My intention was to demonstrate what happens when I do that, expecting that small steps, tests, and refactoring would enable me to improve the design as needed.... In almost every situation, that has turned out to be the case. Incremental design, at least at the level I do it here, works well. And the techniques thereof allow us to improve any code that needs it.<sup id="fnref:jeffries5"><a href="#fn:jeffries5">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, again, is contradicted by the preceding posts.  His attempts to implement constraint propagation had unambiguously failed.  </p>
<p>He began in his seventeenth post, adding a <code>List[Set[Int]]</code> as a sidecar to his core representation.  But since the incremental updates were, as yet, unimplemented, it had to be recomputed after each move.  As a result, his solver became two orders of magnitude slower; his test puzzle, which once took 200ms to solve, now took a full 20 seconds.  </p>
<p>Jeffries seems largely unbothered by this.  He disables the slow test, and begins to look at search heuristics, under the theory that "moving towards more human approaches"<sup id="fnref:jeffries6"><a href="#fn:jeffries6">8</a></sup> might offset the performance loss.  He only returns to it ten days and eleven posts later, at which point he's clearly lost the thread.  Rather than try to implement the incremental updates, he simply makes it so that the <code>List[Set[Int]]</code> is lazily generated.  And since nothing is actually <em>using</em> this new data structure, this "fixes" the issue.  </p>
<p>In the twenty-odd posts that follow, Jeffries never returns to constraint propagation.  Instead, he putters around with search heuristics like naked pairs; something that, again, Norvig's approach makes fairly trivial.  And after the forty-fifth post, Jeffries seems to lose interest.  He has, apparently, reached his destination.</p>
<p>The resulting code is, again, serviceable.  It solves Sudoku puzzles, and has support for various "human approaches" to solving puzzles.  But the implementation<sup id="fnref:implementation"><a href="#fn:implementation">9</a></sup> has a diffuse, muddled quality.  In his <code>Puzzle</code> class, some methods refer to the <code>Set[Int]</code> associated with a cell as <code>possible_answers</code>, and others as <code>candidates</code>.  Likewise, most method names distinguish between <code>position</code> (index) and <code>cell</code> (value), but <code>Puzzle.unknown_cells</code> returns a list of indices.  And while <code>Puzzle</code> began as an immutable representation, somewhere along the way it grew a mutable <code>remove_naked_pair</code> method.</p>
<p>In a larger codebase, these sorts of inconsistencies are inevitable.  Despite our best efforts, entropy creeps in.  But Jeffries' solver is only a few hundred lines of code, and was refined for months on end.  We must treat every line as intentional.</p>
<p>When we say software is <a href="https://explaining.software/archive/glossary/#complexity" target="_blank">simple</a>, we mean it's easy to explain.  Well-designed structure often has a narrative structure; there is a natural order to its components, and each helps to explain the next.  We can see this in Norvig's implementation: it codifies the rules as a set of relationships, and then uses those relationships to solve the problem.</p>
<p>This doesn't happen by accident.  The developer needs to hold the entire <a href="https://explaining.software/archive/glossary/#structure" target="_blank">structure</a> in their head, and find a simple path that connects its constituent parts.  And if no such path can be found, they need to find a better structure. </p>
<p>Jeffries, however, does not believe in bigger pictures; his approach to software design is proudly myopic.  He prevents himself from seeing the forest by pressing his face against the trees.  And sometimes, as he moves from one tree to the next, he takes a moment to celebrate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I refine and refine and refine, the design moves toward smaller objects, with single responsibilities and simple code. The design improves, bit by bit, almost by itself.<sup id="fnref:jeffries7"><a href="#fn:jeffries7">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it doesn't.  Software design is a deliberate process, and requires deliberate effort.  Anything less is just a shrug in the face of entropy.</p>

          <p>Early car sales data for January is starting to arrive from countries across the pond, and they paint an alarming picture for Tesla. Sales are crashing in France, Germany, and the UK—all affluent countries that are key markets for Tesla's electric vehicles. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/teslas-2024-financial-results-are-out-and-theyre-terrible/">Coming on the heels of a large financial miss</a>, it's just one more problem for the automaker.</p>
<p>Tesla sales dropped around 13 percent across Europe in 2024, but so far this year, the scale of the problem is far greater. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-03/tesla-sales-plunge-63-in-france-the-eu-s-second-biggest-ev-market">In France</a>, sales of new Teslas fell by 63 percent, while total car sales in the country fell by just 6 percent, with EV sales dropping just half a percent.</p>
<p>Germany was already looking like lost ground for Tesla—its 41 percent drop in 2024 accounted for most of Tesla's lost sales across Europe. That must make the 59 percent drop in German Tesla sales recorded during January even more painful on the profit and loss statements.</p>
<p>Across the Channel, the British auto industry <a href="https://www.smmt.co.uk/vehicle-data/car-registrations/">just released</a> its sales data for January. Here, Tesla sales fell less precipitously—just 12 percent. However, battery EV sales were 35 percent higher in the UK in January 2025 than in January 2024. The cake is growing, but Tesla is getting to eat less and less of it.</p>

<p>Two years after the <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2023/01/16/servo-2023/">renewed activity</a> on the project we can confirm that Servo is fully back.</p>
<p>If we ignore the bots, in 2024 we’ve had <strong>129 unique contributors</strong> (+143% over 54 last year), <strong>landing 1,771 pull requests</strong> (+163% over 673), and that’s just in <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">our main repo</a>!</p>
<p>Including bots, the total number of PRs merged goes up to <strong>2,674</strong> (+144% over 1094). From all this work, 26% of the PRs were made by Igalia, 40% by other contributors and the rest by the bots (34%). This shows how the Servo community has been growing and becoming more diverse with new actors participating actively in the project.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a look to the data and chart above, which show the evolution since 2018 in number of merged PRs, unique contributors per year and average contributors per month (excluding bots). We can see <strong>the project is back to numbers of 2018 and 2019 when it was been developed in full speed</strong>!</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Servo popularity keeps growing, with many folks realizing there has been new activity on the project last year, and we have more and more people interested in the project.</p>
<figure><a href="https://star-history.com/#servo/servo"><img src="https://servo.org/img/blog/2025-01-servo-github-stars.png" alt="Servo GitHub start history chart showing Servo not stopping going up since 2013, up to more than 25,000 today"></a>
  <figcaption>Servo GitHub stars haven't stopped growing, surpassing now 25K threshold.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During 2024 Servo has been present in <strong>8 events with 9 talks</strong>: <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2321-embedding-servo-in-rust-projects/">FOSDEM</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/RdtlD_7JAs8">Open Source Summit North America</a>, <a href="https://servo.org/slides/2024-04-16-seattle-rust-user-group/">Seattle Rust user meetup</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA_1jxzR85M">GOSIM Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SamA5Oz-G5w">Global Software Technology Summit</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHa4LPpWRh8&amp;t=1351s">Linux Foundation Europe Member Summit</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpz088cxDcI">GOSIM</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c9sHaEXQak">China</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp5n7CSvALA">Ubuntu Summit</a>.</p>
<p>If we focus on development there has been many things moving forward during the year. Servo main dependencies (SpiderMonkey, Stylo and WebRender) have been upgraded, the new layout engine has kept evolving adding support for floats, tables, flexbox, fonts, etc. By the end of 2024 <a href="https://staging.wpt.fyi/results/?sha=58c1148991&amp;label=master&amp;max-count=1&amp;product=servo"><strong>Servo passes 1,515,229 WPT subtests (79%)</strong></a>. Many other new features have been under active development: WebGPU, Shadow DOM, ReadableStream, WebXR, … Servo now supports two new platforms: Android and OpenHarmony. And we have got the first experiments of applications using Servo as a web engine (like <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2024/01/19/embedding-update/">Tauri</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz">Blitz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/KDABLabs/cxx-qt-servo-webview">QtWebView</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mcclure/cuervo/tree/unstable_traversal_experiment">Cuervo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/versotile-org/verso/">Verso</a> and <a href="https://github.com/moto-browser/moto">Moto</a>).</p>
<p>In 2024 we have <strong>raised 33,632.64 USD</strong> with <a href="https://servo.org/sponsorship/">donations via Open Collective and GitHub Sponsors</a> from <strong>500 different people and organizations</strong>. Thank you all for supporting us!</p>
<p>With this money we have now 3 servers that provides self-hosted runners for Linux, macOS, and Windows reducing our build times <strong>from over an our to under 30 minutes</strong>.</p>
<p>Talking about the future, the Servo TSC has been discussing the <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap"><strong>roadmap for 2025</strong></a> which has been updated on the Servo’s wiki. We have many plans to keep Servo thriving with new features and improvements. Let’s hope for a great 2025!</p>

To me personally, it feels unavoidable: I can’t look down at my phone or glance up at a TV without seeing <i>something</i> that makes me upset. And that’s really exhausting. But when outrage is everywhere, what can we do to keep it from getting to us?</p><hr><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/">subscribing</a>. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.</p><hr><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Here to talk to us about fighting so-called outrage fatigue is Tanya Lewis, a senior editor covering health and medicine at <i>Scientific American</i>.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Tanya, thanks for joining us today.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Tanya Lewis:</b> Thanks so much for having me.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> So you recently wrote about this phenomenon called “outrage fatigue.” Could you tell us what that is?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> Sure, so outrage fatigue is kind of an informal concept, which basically refers to repeatedly experiencing perceived moral transgressions and feeling fatigued by them. So what that basically means is just, you know, you see something, you’re outraged by it, and over time you just become kind of numb to it.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Sounds relevant to [laughs], to many of our lives.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> Yes [laughs].</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> What do researchers know about outrage in general?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> So outrage fatigue itself hasn’t been that well-studied, but outrage in general has been studied, and people have found that, actually, outrage can be useful. It actually can help you identify a problem and react to it. But it can also be harmful if you’re experiencing it all the time and become overwhelmed by it.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">There’s actually a recent study by William Brady, an assistant professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. He and his colleagues found that outrage actually helps misinformation spread more widely, especially online on social media. So the upshot of this is that when you have too much outrage, people can actually withdraw from public spaces or virtual places like social media.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Yeah, and what is it about outrage that helps misinformation spread?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> So I think part of it is the fact that it’s more engaging. It, you know, activates your emotions, and so people are more primed to respond to that. As we all know, if you’ve ever spent time on social media and social networks, we always see the most kind of inflammatory content because that’s what gets retweets or clicks and the algorithms are amplifying that.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Right, and more broadly, you know, what is it about the times we’re living in that makes outrage so hard to avoid?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> So we’re living in a particularly polarized time, which I think is not a surprise to anybody. If you have been online lately, on Twitter or Facebook or TikTok or any other social media, you’ve probably seen people yelling about something or other. And this just really has been accelerating, I guess, in the last few years because of our political polarization and other world events.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">As I was saying earlier some amount of outrage is actually normal and healthy, but studies have shown that the majority of outrage posts on social media are actually driven by a small minority of users who are very—you know, they feel very strongly about something, and that can actually turn other people off of participating in the conversation.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Yeah, so social media is a big part of this, you know, both amplifying it and giving a platform for people who are feeling this outrage. Other than just making us feel bad, what does outrage fatigue do to a person?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> So the real danger is that we become apathetic, and if we’re exposed to something all the time—whether it’s through social media or even traditional news sources like cable TV—if it’s constantly telling us to be outraged, eventually we’re gonna be less responsive and we’re gonna kind of pull back. So instead of, like, channeling that outrage into something useful, many people sort of feel exhausted and burned out, and they just don’t want to take action at all.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">And this is actually a problem because politicians can take advantage of that and sort of manipulate people. As we’ve seen over the last few decades some of the big social issues like abortion, gay rights, critical race theory, these have all been used as kind of wedge issues to convince people to vote in ways that might be against their own self-interest because they’re just so outraged about this one particular issue.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Yeah, so definitely worth avoiding. What can we do to accomplish that?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> Right. That was my question, too. You know, a couple of things: one is that we can just sort of limit how much media we consume. As somebody who is a member of the media, you know, this might sound strange, but I think if you’re feeling constantly overwhelmed and outraged by something, if you consume less of it, that’s probably a good thing.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">But it doesn’t mean you should totally sort of ignore what’s happening. When I talked to William Brady, he said that, you know, one of the ways you can kind of have an impact without just being overwhelmed is to get involved in local politics or local issues, you know, in your community because you can actually have a much greater impact on a local level, usually, than a national level anyway. So rather than just, like, retweeting that most outrageous post that you see, you know, it’s better to get involved with real people and kind of have a dialogue with them.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Yeah, find some mutual aid groups ...</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> Exactly.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Find stuff you can actually do when you’re not doomscrolling and hopefully [laughs] ...</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> Yes [laughs].</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Do less of the doomscrolling, too. And did he have any advice for sort of recovering from outrage burnout once it’s hit you?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> Gosh, that is a good question. You know, it’s not something I specifically asked Dr. Brady about, but I think, just from my own experience, like I said, you know, pulling back a little bit from some of the media consumption and, you know, just maybe limiting yourself to checking the news a couple times a day instead of, like, every hour or, you know, getting those alerts on your phone all the time. If someone is posting stuff that makes you furious all the time, maybe don’t follow them [laughs]. And, yeah, get outside, get in nature—you know, the usual things that can kind of reset your brain and make you feel, you know, more calm.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">[CLIP: Theme music]</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Yeah, maybe easier said than done, but really good advice. Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us, Tanya.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> Thanks so much.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>I liked Ubuntu. For a very long time, it was the sensible default option.
Around 2016, I used the Ubuntu GNOME flavor, and after they ditched the Unity desktop environment, GNOME became the
default
option.</p>
<p>I was really happy with it, both for work and personal computing needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.id.ee/en/article/install-id-software/">Estonian ID card software</a> was also officially supported on Ubuntu,
which made Ubuntu a good choice for family members.</p>
<p>But then something changed.</p>
<h3 id="upgrades-suck">Upgrades suck</h3>
<p>Like many Ubuntu users, I stuck to the long-term support releases and upgraded every two years to the next major
version. There was just one tiny little issue: every upgrade broke <em>something.</em></p>
<p>Usually it was a relatively minor issue, with some icons, fonts or themes being a bit funny. Sometimes things went
completely wrong.</p>
<p>The worst upgrade was the one I did on my mothers’ laptop. During the upgrade process from Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04,
everything blew up spectacularly. The UI froze, the machine was completely unresponsive. After a 30-minute wait and a
forced restart later, the installation was absolutely <em><strong>fucked.</strong></em> In frustration, I ended up installing <em><strong>Windows</strong></em>
so
that I don’t have to support Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Another family member, another upgrade. This is one that they did themselves on Lubuntu 18.04, and they upgraded to the
latest version. The result: Firefox shortcuts stopped working, the status bar contained duplicate icons, and random
errors popped up after logging
in. <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/10/14/fedora-starter-pack/#-specific-to-estonia-id-card-support">After making sure that ID card software works on Fedora 40,</a>
I installed that instead. All they need is a working browser, and that’s too difficult for Ubuntu to handle.</p>
<h3 id="snaps-ruined-ubuntu">Snaps ruined Ubuntu</h3>
<p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/core/services/guide/snaps-intro">Snaps</a>. I hate them.</p>
<p>They sound great in theory, but the poor implementation and heavy-handed push by Canonical has been a mess.</p>
<p>Snaps auto-update by default. Great for security<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but horrible for users who want to control what their <em>personal</em>
computer is doing.</p>
<p>Snaps get forced upon users as more and more system components are forcibly switched from Debian-based packages to
Snaps, which breaks compatibility, functionality and introduces a lot of new issues. You can upgrade your Ubuntu
installation and then discover that your browser is now contained within a Snap, the desktop shortcut for it doesn’t
work and your government ID card does not work for logging in to your bank any longer.</p>
<p>Snaps also destroy productivity. A colleague was struggling to get any work done because the desktop environment on
their Ubuntu installation was flashing certain UI elements, being unresponsive and blocking them from doing any work.
Apparently the whole GNOME desktop environment is a Snap now, and that lead to issues.</p>
<p>The fix was <em>super easy, barely an inconvenience:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>roll back to the previous version of the GNOME snap</li>
<li>restart
<ul>
<li>still broken</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>update to the latest version again</li>
<li>restart
<ul>
<li>still broken</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>restart again
<ul>
<li>it is fixed now</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What was the issue?</p>
<p>Absolutely no clue, but a days’ worth of developers’ productivity was completely wasted.</p>
<p>Some of these issues have <em>probably</em> been fixed by now, but if I executed migration projects at my day job with a
similar track record, I would be fired.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="snaps-done-right-flatpak">Snaps done right: Flatpak</h3>
<p>Snaps can be implemented in a way that doesn’t suck for end users. <a href="https://flatpak.org/">It’s called a Flatpak.</a></p>
<p>They work reasonably well, you can update them whenever you want and they are <em><strong>optional</strong></em>. Your Firefox installation
won’t suddenly turn into a Flatpak overnight.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/06/02/steam-deck/">Steam Deck,</a> Flatpaks are the main distribution method for user-installed apps
and I don’t mind it at all. The
only issue is the software selection, not every app is available as a Flatpak just yet.</p>
<h3 id="consider-fedora">Consider Fedora</h3>
<p>Fedora works fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/10/14/fedora-starter-pack/">It’s not perfect,</a> but I like it.</p>
<p>At this point I’ve used it for longer than Ubuntu
and <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/message-red-hat-associates-today">unless IBM ruins it for all of us,</a> I think it
will be a perfectly <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cromulent">cromulent</a> distro go get work done on.</p>
<p>Hopefully it’s not too late for Canonical to reconsider their approach to building a Linux distro.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/02/05/warner-bros-youtube-full-movie-releases/">https://tedium.co/2025/02/05/warner-bros-youtube-full-movie-releases/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42949181">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                    <div>
<p><strong>In recent years, we’ve complained a lot</strong> about Warner Bros. Discovery, in part because their decision-making has seemed <a href="https://tedium.co/2022/08/03/10-unreleased-completed-movies/">almost toxic</a> and <a href="https://tedium.co/2023/11/14/warner-bros-discovery-coyote-vs-acme-film-shelving/">damaging to the creative community</a>. A movie studio that literally makes movies and doesn’t release them? That seems like a bizarre state of affairs, and under David Zaslav, they’ve done it multiple times.</p>
<p>But the studio has recently done something that I’m really just kind of in awe about. Over the last month, across five different YouTube channels, the studio has released more than 30 full movies. On YouTube. For free. Without any sort of gating.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7Eup7JXScZyvRftA2Q5hv69XiegDm6tQ">Much of the collection is here</a>, but it doesn’t appear to even be a complete accounting of what the studio has released on the service. They keep adding movies, too. In the three or four days since I first spotted it, they’ve added at least two or three additional films.</p>
<p>And to be clear, this is not the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/storefront">YouTube Movies</a> service, which is fully licensed and mainly represents a pretty good add-on perk of YouTube Premium subscriptions. Instead, WBD (without notice or promotion) is dropping full-on films that it spent millions of dollars making on its own channels, in a way that makes it feels like it’s saying that the films are commercially spent.</p>
<p>It is embracing a service where a popular type of video is basically watching someone else’s video and commenting on top of it. In some cases, it is likely that those reaction videos will get more views than these movies.</p>




<p>In terms of the quality, most of the films are kind of in the realm where nostalgia hasn’t caught up with them. Some of them are quite good—most notably <em>Waiting for Guffman</em>, <em>Michael Collins</em>, and <em>Crossing Delancey</em>. And some have sheer cult appeal—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhTS_RSQxw4">the 1986 Talking Heads film <em>True Stories</em></a> feels like a surprising choice to show up here, given that David Byrne is still firmly in the mainstream nearly 40 years after the film’s release.</p>

<p>But there are a lot of stinkers and obscurities. One such film on the list: <em>The 11th Hour</em>, an environmental documentary that was created by Leonardo DiCaprio in 2007 but was ultimately overshadowed by the similar <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>, released a year prior. The 2008 film <em>Chaos Theory</em>, starring Ryan Reynolds, shows the film star at the nadir of his commercial power. And then there’s the infamous 2000 New Line Cinema release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDLIGVdJDuQ"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, which was basically forgotten by all but the die-hards before it showed up on this list.</p>
<p>(It is probably a matter of minutes until <em>Town &amp; Country</em>, another infamous flop distributed by New Line during the same period, appears in this playlist.)</p>

<p>At least one film on the list was a bonafide hit upon its initial release—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J8XaQv9A0E">1977’s George Burns comedy <em>Oh, God!</em></a>, which had a $51 million box office run, equivalent to nearly $265 million in 2024 money. But most of the films on this list are more like <em>The Adventures Of Pluto Nash</em>, an infamous 2002 Eddie Murphy dud that came during a period in which Murphy was largely working on poorly reviewed family fare. (If not for <em>Shrek</em>, that entire period would have been a critical bust for Murphy. However, only the adult-oriented <em>Pluto Nash</em> lost money.)</p></div>

<div>
<p>But what stands out more than anything else is that Warner Bros. released them this way, rather than in a format that limits access—something that Warner could easily do, thanks to the fact that it owns the streaming service Max, as well as Turner Classic Movies, a television channel that allows cable customers to stream. (The aforementioned <em>Oh, God!</em> appears on TCM’s website.)</p>

<p>So, what’s going on here? If I was going to speculate, my guess is that Warner has kind of put itself in this awkward place where it has failed to give a home to some of its less-heralded content on streaming services. And in some cases, it kind of feels like a shame. Example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAyg_ENvHzc"><em>The Science of Sleep</em></a>, a 2006 Michel Gondry film that received good reviews and made a small profit at the box office, but simply didn’t reach the critical heights of Gondry’s prior release, <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>. It’s not that this is a bad film—it seems to be, more than anything else, that it is kind of a forgotten one, poorly presented by the studio that paid millions of dollars to make and distribute it.</p>
<p>And honestly, in a lot of ways, that shows why this decision seems so bewildering. By releasing a handful of hidden gems next to some of the worst films it ever released, WBD is doing a disservice to its creative teams of past and present. It is essentially telling its catalog artists that it may simply drop an old film on a service that most people don’t even think of as a streamer.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. is not lacking for proper channels to release this content in full. So why post on YouTube in an DRM-free, region-free way? (For sake of confirming the films didn’t have DRM, I opened up yt-dlp frontend <a href="https://github.com/NickvisionApps/Parabolic/tree/main">Parabolic</a> and had it download two films currently on YouTube: <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em>, which is on YouTube Movies, and <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, which isn’t. The former was blocked from working; the latter downloaded and played easily in VLC.) The message seems to be, “nobody wants this stuff,” which is a weird thing for an entertainment conglomerate to say about its own archives. Even if these films make money through ad revenue, it likely won’t add up to much in residuals compared to a distribution deal.</p>
<p>After all, if you can just watch these films for free here, why would you buy these from Amazon or somewhere else? Well, presumably you could get the films in better quality on Blu-ray. And they might come with commentary tracks, in case you want to hear about the decisions that led to <em>Pluto Nash</em> being made. But there likely aren’t a lot of die-hard fans of most of these movies; they probably don’t need more than the videos themselves.</p>
<p>For years, the line we heard from movie studios was that these movies needed to be protected with strict digital rights management to prevent them from appearing in the wrong hands. This works against that.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it’s perhaps the way things are going. <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/01/17/ernie-kovacs-lost-episode-resurfaced/">As I noted in my recent piece on Ernie Kovacs</a>, YouTube is increasingly seen as the best option for releasing content made before the 1980s, as Netflix and other services seem to be favoring more recent works. Perhaps this signifies that it’s an issue for even the big studios.</p>
<p>All that said: I’m not exactly sure what message WBD is sending here by offloading these seemingly random movies in such a bewildering way. But maybe it’s a sign that, once the long tail starts thinning out, the streaming revolution isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE0bQ4Fjbms"><em>Waiting for Guffman</em></a> still holds up, and you can watch it on YouTube, for free.</p></div><div>

                                                                        <p><img alt="Stock Windows 10 and 11 wallpapers" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/11/1699098103_windows_10_and_windows_11_story.jpg"></p>

<p>Back in October 2021, when Microsoft made the original Windows 11, version 21H2, generally available, the company, perhaps unimaginably, had also provided a <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-makes-the-tpm-bypass-for-unsupported-pcs-official-but-with-lots-of-warning/">workaround that bypassed the system requirements</a> which would allow users on unsupported PCs to upgrade too.</p>

<p>If you remember the days, there was a widespread objection against the stringent OS hardware requirements, something that is quite prevalent even today, as Microsoft recently had to <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-confirms-its-not-lowering-windows-11-system-requirements-for-unsupported-hardware/">clarify it was not relaxing</a> the Windows 11 hardware eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>The workaround that Microsoft had published involved tweaking a Registry key that would allow a Windows 11 upgrade on unsupported PCs by bypassing CPU and TPM checks:</p>

                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft recommends against installing Windows 11 on a device that does not meet the Windows 11 minimum system requirements. If you choose to install Windows 11 on a device that does not meet these requirements, and you <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-confirms-its-not-lowering-windows-11-system-requirements-for-unsupported-hardware/">acknowledge and understand the risks</a>, you can create the following registry key values and bypass the check for TPM 2.0 (at least TPM 1.2 is required) and the CPU family and model.</li>
	<li>Registry Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup</li>
	<li>Name: AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU</li>
	<li>Type: REG_DWORD</li>
	<li>Value: 1</li>
	<li>Note: Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method. These problems might require that you reinstall the operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that these problems can be solved. Modify the registry at your own risk.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>However, Neowin noticed today while browsing that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240929145620/https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ways-to-install-windows-11-e0edbbfb-cfc5-4011-868b-2ce77ac7c70e">support article</a> which hosted this information has been edited since and the above workaround has been deleted. The change was made sometime recently after the release of <a href="https://www.neowin.net/reviews/windows-11-24h2-vs-23h2-performance-benchmark-in-2025-clean-install-vs-in-place-upgrade/">Windows 11 24H2</a>. Thus Microsoft no longer officially endorses this bypass method even though the trick itself may work.</p>

<p>Microsoft's current <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-officially-recommends-a-new-pc-and-onedrive-to-update-to-windows-11/">official recommendation is a new PC</a> for updating to Windows 11, so clearly the company is not a fan of those updating to 11 on unsupported devices, which is likely why it no longer wants to inform users about the Registry workaround. Microsoft's partners <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/dell-amd-give-a-reason-why-microsoft-officially-recommends-a-new-pc-to-update-to-windows-11/">like Dell and AMD</a> have expressed they are likely on board with this too.</p>

<p>With Microsoft justifying how <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-wants-you-to-understand-why-deprecation-of-windows-features-is-good-for-you/">deprecation is actually a good thing for users</a>, the upcoming <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/is-windows-11-free-update-for-limited-time-only-microsoft-might-not-be-so-sure-now/">end of support for Windows 10</a> will certainly be interesting from the hardware standpoint.</p>
                        
                        
                                                                    </div></div>]]></description>

	<p>A new paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393">released on Friday</a> is making waves in the AI community, not because of the model 
it describes, but because it shows how close we are to some very large breakthroughs in AI. The model
is just below state of the art, but it can run on my laptop. More important, it sheds light on how all
this stuff works, and it’s <strong>not complicated</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="inference-scaling-wait-for-me">Inference Scaling: “Wait” For Me!</h2>
<p>OpenAI were the first to claim the inference-time scaling laws. Basically, an LLM can get higher performance
if it can “think” longer before answering. But, like, <strong>how do you do it?</strong> How do you make it think longer?</p>

<p>OpenAI and R1 had cool graphs showing performance scaling with average thinking time (this from
the s1 paper):</p>

<p><img src="https://timkellogg.me/images/s1-inference-scaling.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>But <strong>how</strong> do they control the length of an LLM response? Everyone skipped over that part, but s1
shows us details, <em>and it is fun</em>.</p>

<p><em>Context: When an LLM “thinks” at inference time, it puts it’s thoughts inside <code>&lt;think&gt;</code> and 
<code>&lt;/think&gt;</code> XML tags. Once it gets past the end tag the model is taught to change voice into a confident
and authoritative tone for the final answer.</em></p>

<p>In s1, when the LLM tries to stop thinking with <code>"&lt;/think&gt;"</code>, they force it to keep going
by replacing it with <code>"Wait"</code>. It’ll then begin to second guess and double check it’s answer. They
do this to trim or extend thinking time (trimming is just abruptly inserting <code>"&lt;/think&gt;"</code>).</p>

<p>It’s really dumb, I love it. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/r.whal.ing/post/3lheatlmonk26">It feels like the kind of hack I would try</a>.</p>

<p>So for <code>o3-mini-low</code> versus <code>o3-mini-high</code>, that’s likely how they do it. They probably trained 3
models, and with each with a different average thinking time (as measured during training). Eventually the 
training process begins to encode that behavior into the model weights.</p>

<h2 id="the-entropix-tie-in">The Entropix Tie In</h2>
<p>The trick is so dumb you can do it at inference time too. I’m kicking myself for not understanding
this earlier, because it’s what entropix is all about, and <a href="https://timkellogg.me/blog/2024/10/10/entropix">I wrote a lot about entropix</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/xjdr-alt/entropix">entropix</a>, they look at the entropy &amp; varentropy of the logits (and attention) to change how the
tokens are selected. In fact, they used tokens like “Wait” to force the LLM to second guess itself.
Although there was more to it, they also tweaked sampler setting to make
it more creative, or to go into aggressive exploration mode, all depending on the internal state
of the model.</p>

<p>My hunch is that we’ll <strong>see more</strong> of entropix, or something directly inspired from it. Although, it’s
unclear if it’ll appear predominately in training or inference time.</p>

<h2 id="extreme-data-frugality">Extreme Data Frugality</h2>
<p>Why did it cost only $6? Because they used a <strong>small model</strong> and hardly any data.</p>

<p>After sifting their dataset of 56K examples down to just the best 1K, they found that the core 1K 
is all that’s needed to achieve o1-preview performance on a 32B model. <strong>Adding data didn’t raise 
performance <em>at all</em></strong>.</p>

<p>32B is a small model, I can run that on my laptop. They used 16 NVIDIA H100s for 26 minutes per 
training run, that equates to around $6.</p>

<p>The low cost means you can do a lot of runs, and they did. As we’ll see, they heavily used a 
technique called ablation, re-running the entire training process with <strong>small variations</strong> in 
configuration to prove what works and what doesn’t.</p>

<p>For example, how did they figure out it should be “Wait” and not “Hmm”? <strong>They measured!</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://timkellogg.me/images/s1-ablations.png" alt=""></p>

<p>They also measured properties of the training dataset, which examples provided the most signal:</p>

<p><img src="https://timkellogg.me/images/s1-diversity.png" alt=""></p>

<p>They did a ton of these ablation experiments. This is how you <strong>make progress</strong>.</p>

<p>We like to think that
OpenAI or DeepSeek are simply packed full of brilliant people and they make a wild guess, spend
$10,000,000.00 on a training run and BAM! an innovation is created. But no, even the smartest
people make hundreds of <strong>tiny experiments</strong>.</p>

<p>Innovations like s1 that dramatically lower costs mean that researchers can learn and understand
these models faster. And that directly translates to a <strong>faster pace</strong> of AI development.</p>

<h2 id="geopolitics">Geopolitics</h2>
<p>Again, AI is inseparable from politics, sorry.</p>

<p>There’s debate about OpenAI &amp; Anthropic’s vast funding. It’s tempting to see cost reducing 
innovations like s1 or DeepSeek V3 and assume that OpenAI &amp; Anthropic’s vast datacenters are
a waste of money. I’d argue that no, having 10,000 H100s just means that you can do 625 times
<strong>more experiments</strong> than s1 did.</p>

<p>If you believe that AI development is a prime national security advantage, then you absolutely
should want even more money poured into AI development, to make it go <strong>even faster</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="distealing">Distealing</h2>
<p>Note that this s1 dataset is <strong>distillation</strong>. Every example is a thought trace generated by 
another model, Qwen2.5,
prompted to think before answering. OpenAI has been accusing DeepSeek of creating their
<a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/tree/main">V3 model</a> by distilling from o1, which is against their terms of service. There’s still no strong public
evidence in either direction, so accusations are mostly empty, but s1 gives a lot of credence.</p>

<p>Going forward, it’ll be nearly impossible to prevent distealing (unauthorized distilling). One thousand
examples is definitely within the range of what a single person might do in normal usage, no less 
ten or a hundred people. I doubt that OpenAI has a realistic path to <strong>preventing</strong> or even <strong>detecting</strong>
distealing outside of simply not releasing models.</p>

<p>Note that OpenAI released their o3 model as
<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/">deep research</a>, an agent instead of direct access to the model API. This might be a trend now,
“agents” serving as a way to avoid releasing direct access to a model.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>S1 is important because it illustrates the current pace of AI development that’s happening in
the open. When you consider how much compute is available to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic,
the potential true pace of AI development is <strong>mind melting</strong>.</p>

<p>S1 isn’t a replication of R1 or o1. Those were demonstrations in pure reinforcement learning (RL).
S1 shows that supervised fine tuning (SFT) shows just as much potential. That means researchers have
multiple paths to investigate for pushing forward inference-time scaling.</p>

<p>I think it’s safe to say that we’re going to see some very big things in ‘25. It’s barely February…</p>

        <h2>Go Data Structures

        <div>
        <p>

            Posted on Tuesday, November 24, 2009.


        </p>
        </div>
        </h2>
       

<p>When explaining Go to new programmers, I've found that it often helps to explain what Go values look like in memory, to build the right intuition about which operations are expensive and which are not. This post is about basic types, structs, arrays, and slices.</p>
<h2>Basic types</h2>
<p>Let's start with some simple examples:</p><center><img src="http://research.swtch.com/godata1.png"></center>
<p>The variable <code>i</code> has type <code>int</code>, represented in memory as a single 32-bit word.  (All these pictures show a 32-bit memory layout; in the current implementations, only the pointer gets bigger on a 64-bit machine—<code>int</code> is still 32 bits—though an implementation could choose to use 64 bits instead.) </p>
<p>The variable <code>j</code> has type <code>int32</code>, because of the explicit conversion.  Even though <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> have the same memory layout, they have different types: the assignment <code>i = j</code> is a type error and must be written with an explicit conversion: <code>i = int(j)</code>. </p>
<p>The variable <code>f</code> has type <code>float</code>, which the current implementations represent as a 32-bit floating-point value. It has the same memory footprint as the <code>int32</code> but a different internal layout. </p>

<h2>Structs and pointers</h2>
<p>Now things start to pick up. The variable <code>bytes</code> has type <code>[5]byte</code>, an array of 5 <code>byte</code>s.  Its memory representation is just those 5 bytes, one after the other, like a C array. Similarly, <code>primes</code> is an array of 4 <code>int</code>s. </p>
<p>Go, like C but unlike Java, gives the programmer control over what is and is not a pointer.  For example, this type definition: </p>
<pre>type Point struct { X, Y int }
</pre>
<p> defines a simple struct type named <code>Point</code>, represented as two adjacent <code>int</code>s in memory.</p><center><img src="http://research.swtch.com/godata1a.png"></center>
<p>The <a href="http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html#Composite_literals">composite literal syntax</a> <code>Point{10, 20}</code> denotes an initialized <code>Point</code>. Taking the address of a composite literal  denotes a pointer to a freshly allocated and initialized <code>Point</code>. The former is two words in memory; the latter is a pointer to two words in memory. </p>
<p>Fields in a struct are laid out side by side in memory.</p>
<pre>type Rect1 struct { Min, Max Point }
type Rect2 struct { Min, Max *Point }</pre><center><img src="http://research.swtch.com/godata1b.png"></center>
<p><code>Rect1</code>, a struct with two <code>Point</code> fields, is represented by two <code>Point</code>s—four ints—in a row. <code>Rect2</code>, a struct with two <code>*Point</code> fields, is represented by two <code>*Point</code>s.</p>
<p>Programmers who have used C probably won't be surprised by the distinction between <code>Point</code> fields and <code>*Point</code> fields, while programmers who have only used Java or Python (or ...) may be surprised by having to make the decision. By giving the programmer control over basic memory layout, Go provides the ability to control the total size of a given collection of data structures, the number of allocations, and the memory access patterns, all of which are important for building systems that perform well. </p>
<h2>Strings</h2>
<p>With those preliminaries, we can move on to more interesting data types.</p><center><img src="http://research.swtch.com/godata2.png"></center>
<p>(The gray arrows denote pointers that are present in the implementation but not directly visible in programs.)</p>
<p>A <code>string</code> is represented in memory as a 2-word structure containing a pointer to the string data and a length. Because the <code>string</code> is immutable, it is safe for multiple strings to share the same storage, so <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=8082954141980125536&amp;postID=65253524121904390">slicing</a> <code>s</code> results in a new 2-word structure with a potentially different pointer and length that still refers to the same byte sequence.  This means that slicing can be done without allocation or copying, making string slices as efficient as passing around explicit indexes.</p>
<p>(As an aside, there is a <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4513622">well-known gotcha</a> in Java and other languages that when you slice a string to save a small piece, the reference to the original keeps the entire original string in memory even though only a small amount is still needed. Go has this gotcha too.  The alternative, which we tried <a href="http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=70fa38e5a5bb">and rejected</a>, is to make string slicing so expensive—an allocation and a copy—that most programs avoid it.)</p>
<h2>Slices</h2><center><img src="http://research.swtch.com/godata3.png"></center>
<p>A <a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#slices">slice</a> is a reference to a section of an array. In memory, it is a 3-word structure contaning a pointer to the first element, the length of the slice, and the capacity. The length is the upper bound for indexing operations like <code>x[i]</code> while the capacity is the upper bound for slice operations like <code>x[i:j]</code>. </p>
<p>Like slicing a string, slicing an array does not make a copy: it only creates a new structure holding a different pointer, length, and capacity. In the example, evaluating the composite literal <code>[]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11}</code>  creates a new array containing the five values and then sets the fields of the slice <code>x</code> to describe that array. The slice expression <code>x[1:3]</code> does not allocate more data: it just writes the fields of a new slice structure to refer to  the same backing store. In the example, the length is 2—<code>y[0]</code> and <code>y[1]</code> are the only valid indexes—but the capacity is 4—<code>y[0:4]</code> is a valid slice expression. (See <a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#slices">Effective Go</a> for more about length and capacity and how slices are used.) </p>
<p> Because slices are multiword structures, not pointers, the slicing operation does not need to allocate memory, not even for the slice header, which can usually be kept on the stack. This representation makes slices about as cheap to use as passing around explicit pointer and length pairs in C. Go originally represented a slice as a pointer to the structure shown above, but doing so meant that every slice operation allocated a new memory object.  Even with a fast allocator, that creates a lot of unnecessary work for the garbage collector, and we found that, as was the case with strings above, programs avoided slicing operations in favor of passing explicit indices.  Removing the indirection and the allocation made slices cheap enough to avoid passing explicit indices in most cases. </p>
<h2>New and Make</h2>
<p>Go has two data structure creation functions: <code>new</code> and <code>make</code>. The distinction is a common early point of confusion but seems to quickly become natural. The basic distinction is that <code>new(T)</code> returns a <code>*T</code>, a pointer that Go programs can dereference implicitly (the black pointers in the diagrams), while <code>make(T, </code><i>args</i><code>)</code> returns an ordinary <code>T</code>, not a pointer. Often that <code>T</code> has inside it some implicit pointers (the gray pointers in the diagrams). <code>New</code> returns a pointer to zeroed memory, while <code>make</code> returns a complex structure.</p><center><img src="http://research.swtch.com/godata4.png"></center>
<p>There is a way to unify these two, but it would be a significant break from the C and C++ tradition: define <code>make(*T)</code> to return a pointer to a newly allocated <code>T</code>, so that the current <code>new(Point)</code> would be written <code>make(*Point)</code>. We tried this for a few days but decided it was too different from what people expected of an allocation function.</p>
<h2>Coming soon...</h2>
<p>This has already gotten a bit long. Interface values, maps, and channels will have to wait for future posts.</p>

<p>There have been many the­o­ries of how human his­to­ry works. Some, like Ger­man thinker <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2017/01/an-introduction-to-hegels-philosophy-of-history.html">G.W.F. Hegel</a>, have thought of progress as inevitable.&nbsp;Oth­ers have embraced a more sta­t­ic view, full of “Great Men” and an immutable nat­ur­al order.&nbsp;Then we have the counter-Enlight­en­ment thinker <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/vico/">Giambat­tista Vico</a>. The 18th cen­tu­ry Neapoli­tan philoso­pher took human irra­tional­ism seri­ous­ly, and wrote about our&nbsp;ten­den­cy to rely on myth and metaphor rather than rea­son or nature. Vico’s most “rev­o­lu­tion­ary move,” wrote Isa­iah Berlin, “is to have denied the doc­trine of a time­less nat­ur­al law” that could be “known in prin­ci­ple to any man, at any time, any­where.”</p>
<p>Vico’s the­o­ry of his­to­ry includ­ed inevitable peri­ods of decline (and heav­i­ly influ­enced the&nbsp;his­tor­i­cal think­ing of James Joyce and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/">Friedrich Niet­zsche</a>). He describes his con­cept “most col­or­ful­ly,” writes Alexan­der Bert­land&nbsp;at the <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/vico/">Inter­net Ency­clo­pe­dia of Phi­los­o­phy</a>, “when he gives this axiom”:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Men first felt neces­si­ty then look for util­i­ty, next attend to com­fort, still lat­er amuse them­selves with plea­sure, thence grow dis­solute in lux­u­ry, and final­ly go mad and waste their sub­stance.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The descrip­tion may remind us of Shakespeare’s “<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/360/7/88.html">Sev­en Ages of Man</a>.”&nbsp;But for&nbsp;Vico, Bert­land&nbsp;notes, every decline her­alds a new begin­ning. His­to­ry&nbsp;is “pre­sent­ed clear­ly as a cir­cu­lar motion in which nations rise and fall… over and over again.”</p>


<p>Two-hun­dred and twen­ty&nbsp;years after Vico’s 1774 death, Carl Sagan—another thinker who took human irra­tional­ism seriously—published his book&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2js5Hrz"><em>The Demon Haunt­ed World</em></a>, show­ing&nbsp;how much our every­day think­ing derives from metaphor, mythol­o­gy, and super­sti­tion. He also fore­saw&nbsp;a future in which his nation, the U.S., would fall into a peri­od of ter­ri­ble decline:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I have a fore­bod­ing of an Amer­i­ca in my chil­dren’s or grand­chil­dren’s time — when the Unit­ed States is a ser­vice and infor­ma­tion econ­o­my; when near­ly all the man­u­fac­tur­ing indus­tries have slipped away to oth­er coun­tries; when awe­some tech­no­log­i­cal pow­ers are in the hands of a very few, and no one rep­re­sent­ing the pub­lic inter­est can even grasp the issues; when the peo­ple have lost the abil­i­ty to set their own agen­das or knowl­edge­ably ques­tion those in author­i­ty; when, clutch­ing our crys­tals and ner­vous­ly con­sult­ing our horo­scopes, our crit­i­cal fac­ul­ties in decline, unable to dis­tin­guish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost with­out notic­ing, back into super­sti­tion and dark­ness…</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sagan believed in progress and, unlike Vico, thought that “time­less nat­ur­al law” is&nbsp;dis­cov­er­able with the tools of sci­ence. And yet, he feared “the can­dle in the dark” of sci­ence would be snuffed out by “the dumb­ing down of Amer­i­ca…”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>…most evi­dent in the slow decay of sub­stan­tive con­tent in the enor­mous­ly influ­en­tial media, the 30 sec­ond sound bites (now down to 10 sec­onds or less), low­est com­mon denom­i­na­tor pro­gram­ming, cred­u­lous pre­sen­ta­tions on pseu­do­science and super­sti­tion, but espe­cial­ly a kind of cel­e­bra­tion of igno­rance…</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sagan died in 1996, a year after he wrote these words. No doubt he would have seen the fine art of dis­tract­ing and mis­in­form­ing peo­ple&nbsp;through social media as a late, per­haps ter­mi­nal, sign of the demise of sci­en­tif­ic think­ing. His&nbsp;pas­sion­ate advo­ca­cy for sci­ence edu­ca­tion stemmed from his con­vic­tion that we must and can reverse the down­ward trend.</p>

<p><span><iframe title="YouTube video player" type="text/html" width="640" height="505" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ECuarAmpK00?wmode=transparent&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=0&amp;theme=dark" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></iframe></span>

</div>

<p>As he says in the poet­ic excerpt from <em>Cos­mos</em>&nbsp;above, “I believe our future depends pow­er­ful­ly on how well we under­stand this cos­mos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morn­ing sky.”</p>
<p>When Sagan refers to “our” under­stand­ing of sci­ence, he does&nbsp;not mean, as he says above, a “very few” tech­nocrats, aca­d­e­mics, and research sci­en­tists. Sagan&nbsp;invest­ed so much effort&nbsp;in pop­u­lar books and tele­vi­sion because he believed that all of us need­ed to use the tools of sci­ence: “a way of think­ing,” not just “a body of knowl­edge.” With­out sci­en­tif­ic think­ing, we can­not grasp the most impor­tant issues we all joint­ly face.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We’ve arranged a civ­i­liza­tion in which most cru­cial ele­ments pro­found­ly depend on sci­ence and tech­nol­o­gy. We have also arranged things so that almost no one under­stands sci­ence and tech­nol­o­gy. This is a pre­scrip­tion for dis­as­ter. We might get away with it for a while, but soon­er or lat­er this com­bustible mix­ture of igno­rance and pow­er is going to blow up in our faces.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sagan’s 1995 pre­dic­tions are now being her­ald­ed as prophet­ic. As Direc­tor of Pub­lic Radio International’s Sci­ence Fri­day, Charles Bergquist&nbsp;tweet­ed, “Carl Sagan had either a time machine or a crys­tal ball.” Matt Novak&nbsp;cau­tions against falling back into super­sti­tious think­ing in our praise of&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2js5Hrz"><em>Demon Haunt­ed World</em></a>. After all, he says, “the ‘accu­ra­cy’ of pre­dic­tions is often a Rorschach test” and “some of Sagan’s con­cerns” in oth­er parts of the book “sound rather quaint.”</p>
<p>Of course Sagan could­n’t pre­dict the future, but he did have a very informed, rig­or­ous under­stand­ing of the issues of thir­ty years ago, and his pre­dic­tion extrap­o­lates from trends that have only con­tin­ued to deep­en. If the tools of sci­ence education—like most of the coun­try’s wealth—end up the sole prop­er­ty of an elite, the rest of us will fall back into a state of gross igno­rance, “super­sti­tion and dark­ness.” Whether we might come back around again to progress, as Giambat­tista Vico thought, is a mat­ter of sheer con­jec­ture. But per­haps there’s still time to reverse the trend before the worst arrives. As Novak writes, “here’s hop­ing Sagan, one of the smartest peo­ple of the 20th cen­tu­ry, was wrong.”</p>
