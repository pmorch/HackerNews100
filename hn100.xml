                    <p>Good evening.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings.</p>

<p>I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.</p>

<p>This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.</p>

<p>This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.</p>

<p>I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Not that long ago I became aware of Justine Tunney’s <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">cosmopolitan libc</a> project. It’s a toolkit that allows you to compile C source code into a single binary that runs natively on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, various flavours of BSD, even including booters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, back then the project didn’t seem to support GUI interfaces and produces quite swollen binaries. Hence I decided to take a stab at a similar (simpler? harder? up to you to decide) challenge: create a video game (&lt;16 KiB) that runs natively on Windows, Linux and in the Browser, all from a single source file.</p>
<h2 id="the-game">The Game<a href="#the-game" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>It’s a pretty standard Snake game with the same rules and interface on all platforms. You control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, and the goal is to avoid running into walls. The snake is controlled using either the arrow keys or WASD keys. It can be terminated via <code>ESC</code> (if permissible by the platform), reset via <code>R</code>, and paused via <code>P</code>. Spacebar starts the game.</p>
<p>The game keeps track of your score. Each piece of food eaten increases your score by 10 points, except yellow fruit (which spawns with a 15% chance) that gives you 20 points. Fruit spawns at a fixed rate and despawns after a certain time if not eaten. The despawn timer is proportional to the speed of the snake at the time of spawning, which itself is proportional to the snake’s length.</p>
<p>Once ten fruit are eaten, the game proceeds to the next level, randomizing the walls’ layout. The maze is created as to ensure that there is always a path from the snake’s head to any piece of food. The initial placement of the snake is also randomized, but always in a position that has at least five empty tiles in the direction the snake is facing.</p>
<p><a href="https://iczelia.net/static/snake/snake.com"><strong>Download the game here (13,772 bytes)</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-polyglot">The Polyglot<a href="#the-polyglot" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I implemented the game three times in total: once in C for the i686 Visual C platform using WinAPI, once in C for the x86_64 Linux platform using clang and X11, and once in JavaScript for the browser using HTML5 Canvas. Each implementation is around 3-5 KiB in size when compiled/minified.</p>
<p>The Windows implementation was produced using a compressing script that prepends a decompressing stub. This stub has a quite unusual PE header that has many freely controllable bytes after the <code>MZ</code> signature. This allows us to place a shell script there that skips over the remainder of the file, rendering the (valid) PE executable runnable on Windows while also making the entire file a valid shell script, that will do (thus far) nothing on Linux.</p>
<p>Because the PE file is so awkward, we rely on Windows’ apphelp mechanism. Without compatibility mode, executing for the first time will yield the message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000005). Click OK to close the application.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which should disappear after re-running.</p>
<p>The Linux implementation was produced using a similar approach; we use <code>lzma</code> for decompression and a small shell dropper that extracts the compressed ELF64 binary and runs it, skipping over the head and the tail of the file.</p>
<p>The HTML version is also packed and abuses the fact that browsers will happily process all the benign garbage at the start of the file before reaching the actual HTML content. Then we make it invisible/unobtrusive through a bit of CSS magic.</p>
<p>Finally, we concatenate all three files together in such an order that each platform will pick the correct part of the file to execute. The final file is exactly 13,312 bytes in size.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p>by <a href="https://fulghum.io/">Jordan Fulghum</a>, January 2026</p>

    <p><em>Your home server's new sysadmin: Claude Code</em></p>

    <p>I have flirted with self-hosting at home for years. I always bounced off it - too much time spent configuring instead of using. It just wasn't fun.</p>

    <p>That changed recently. The reason is simple: CLI agents like <a href="https://claude.com/claude-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Code</a> make self-hosting on a cheapo home server dramatically easier and actually fun.</p>

    <p>This is the first time I would recommend it to normie/software-literate people who never really wanted to sign up to become a sysadmin and stress about uptime of core personal services.</p>

    <h2>Why now is different</h2>

    <p>Three things converged:</p>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>Shift</th>
            <th>Why it matters</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cheap, capable mini PCs</td>
            <td>You can buy a silent, low-power Linux box for less than a weekend trip</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Tailscale</td>
            <td>Secure networking without port forwarding or networking brain damage</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Claude Code</td>
            <td>You no longer need to remember Docker syntax, Compose quirks, or config formats</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>The last one is the real unlock.</p>

    <p>Instead of Googling "docker compose vaultwarden caddy reverse proxy" and stitching together five blog posts from 2021, I just let Claude figure out (up to you how much you care to really understand the technical details!).</p>

    <h2>The hardware</h2>

    <div>
        <video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline=""><source src="https://fulghum.io/beelink.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
        <p>Fits in one hand. Check that central cooling unit!</p>
    </div>

    <p>I previously ran my Plex server on an M1 Mac mini, which was great, but as I wanted to add more services I found myself running a lot of resource-hungry VMs (via UTM) and it was getting complicated anytime the Mac rebooted. So, I picked up a <a href="https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-me-mini-n150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beelink Mini N150</a>. It is small, quiet, and just barely sips power. I paid around $379 for the device and another few hundred USD for 8TB in NVMe SSD. It's pretty wild how accessible these mini PCs have become in recent years!</p>

    <h2>The basic flow</h2>

    <p>This is the entire workflow:</p>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>Step</th>
            <th></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Install Linux</td>
            <td>Flash USB, install Ubuntu Server (I picked 22.04 LTS) </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Install Tailscale</td>
            <td>Get it on your private network to make your life easier</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SSH in</td>
            <td>From my laptop, anywhere</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Install Claude Code</td>
            <td>On the server itself</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Ask for what I want</td>
            <td>Go get a coffee</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>



    <h2>Claude Code is your new sysadmin</h2>

    <p>This is the part that surprised me. I've been using Claude Code and other agentic CLIs for my day-to-day development, but as others are realizing, they are generalized computer agents and native to the terminal.</p>

    <p>I installed Claude Code directly on the Linux box. Then I asked it things like:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Set up Docker</li>
        <li>Create a Docker Compose file</li>
        <li>Install a service</li>
        <li>Put services behind Caddy</li>
        <li>Persist data properly</li>
        <li>Keep my Docker images up to date</li>
        <li>Set up reasonable security packages</li>
        <li>Restart on boot so I never have to futz with it after an outage</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/claude-code.png" alt="Claude Code running on the Linux server via SSH"></p><p>Claude Code running directly on the server. Just describe what you want.</p>
    </div>

    <p>I didn't copy-paste YAML from the internet or have to do deep googling. I just asked.</p>

    <h2>What's running</h2>

    <p>I focused on things I already used, but wanted more control over - effectively starting to knock down the walled garden around my core services like passwords, photos, media.</p>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>Service</th>
            <th>What it replaces or does</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vaultwarden</a></td>
            <td>Bitwarden, but self-hosted and fast</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://plex.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex</a></td>
            <td>Media server - PSA get Plex Pass to unlock hardware-accelerated transcoding</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://immich.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immich</a></td>
            <td>Google Photos replacement</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uptime Kuma</a></td>
            <td>Simple service monitoring</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://caddyserver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caddy</a></td>
            <td>Reverse proxy with automatic TLS</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Assistant</a></td>
            <td>Home automation hub</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://readeck.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReadDeck</a></td>
            <td>Read-it-later. Honestly blown away by this one!</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>Each one lives in its own container.</p>

    <p>I can access everything from my phone, laptop, and tablet like it is local.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/uptime-kuma.png" alt="Uptime Kuma dashboard showing service monitoring"></p><p>Uptime Kuma keeping an eye on everything.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/monitor.png" alt="Email inbox showing service up/down alerts"></p><p>Automatic alerts via email give me peace of mind.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When something goes down, I get an email. When it comes back up, another email. No pager duty, no complex alerting rules. Just a simple ping that tells me if I need to care.</p>

    <h3>Vaultwarden as the anchor</h3>

    <p>Vaultwarden was kinda the "okay, this can work" moment.</p>

    <p>It is a Bitwarden-compatible server written in Rust. Lightweight, reliable, and you can use the existing Bitwarden clients (like native apps and browser extensions). You can even set it as the default password manager on iOS, at the OS level!</p>

    <p>Once that was running, I exported my passwords from iCloud/Keychain, imported them easily into Vaultwarden, and haven't looked back since.</p>

    <p>That alone justified the box.</p>

    <h3>Immich is actually great</h3>

    <p>Immich is a serious Google Photos replacement. I thought I'd have to compromise and flinched a bit when I installed it. But nope, it's good. Mobile apps. Face recognition via a local (but slow) machine learning thread. Timeline and map view. Automatic uploads from your photo roll.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/immich.png" alt="Immich photo timeline interface"></p><p>Immich. This is not a compromise. This is better.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This is the kind of thing that used to feel fragile and half-baked when self-hosted. It does not anymore.</p>

    <h3>ReadDeck fills the Pocket-shaped hole</h3>

    <p>Mozilla killed Pocket. I needed a replacement.</p>

    <p>I took a bet on ReadDeck. The UI is genuinely good. Clean typography, nice reading experience, good mobile support. It always remembers where I stopped reading and takes me right there. I even set up a shortcut that allows me to save an article for later right from mobile Firefox. Awesome.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/read-deck.png" alt="ReadDeck interface showing saved articles"></p><p>ReadDeck. No lock-in nor surprise sunsetting.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This is exactly the kind of thing self-hosting is perfect for. A small, personal tool that you actually use every day.</p>

    <h2>Utilities for fun</h2>
    <h3>Lazydocker</h3>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lazydocker</a> is a terminal UI for Docker. It shows you all your containers, logs, stats, and lets you restart or shell into anything with a few keystrokes.</p>

    <p>I have been a huge fan of <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit" target="_blank">Lazygit</a> for some time. I think it's one of the best UIs I've ever used. So I was excited to learn that Lazydocker is basically that, but for monitoring Docker containers. No memorizing <code>docker ps</code> flags or grepping through logs. Just SSH in, type <code>lazydocker</code>, and everything is right there.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/lazydocker.png" alt="Lazydocker terminal UI showing running containers"></p><p>You feel like a superhero after you ssh in and see this</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>For a fuller picture, <a href="https://github.com/nicolargo/glances" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glances</a> shows everything at once: CPU, memory, disk, network, and all running containers.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/glances.png" alt="Glances system monitor showing CPU, memory, and container stats"></p><p>Glances showing the whole picture. 13 containers, 6% CPU, 32% memory. This little box barely breaks a sweat.</p>
    </div>

    <p>That is 13 services running on a $379 mini PC, using about 4 GB of RAM and almost no CPU. The N150 is not a powerhouse, but it does not need to be.</p>

    <h2>What it 'feels' like</h2>

    <p>This does not feel like "running a server."</p>

    <p>The feeling of ownership is powerful, but a bit hard to describe. I think you just have to try it, and I hope you get a strong feeling of <em>independence</em> like I have.</p>

    <p>When something breaks, I SSH in, ask the agent what is wrong, and fix it. When I want to add something new, I describe it in plain English.</p>

    <p>I am spending time using software, learning, and having fun - instead of maintaining it and stressing out about it.</p>

    <h2>Who this is for</h2>

    <p>This is for people who:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Are comfortable in a terminal</li>
        <li>Already pay for SaaS tools</li>
        <li>Like understanding how things work</li>
        <li>Do not want to become infra experts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If that is you, I really think this is the year to try self-hosting.</p>

    <p>For the first time, I would say this is not just viable. It is fun.</p>

								<p><span>Chinese car giant BYD has reportedly been offering LiDAR sensors in upcoming versions of some of its cheapest cars on the market.</span></p>
<p><span>According to </span><a href="https://carnewschina.com/2026/01/09/byd-entry-level-hatchbacks-to-feature-lidar-sensors-in-china/"><span>CNC</span></a><span>, the latest to be approved versions of both the Seagull, known as the Atto 1 in Australia, and the Dolphin hatchback will come equipped with LiDAR sensors to improve advanced driver assistance system offerings on these cars.</span></p>
<p><span>With this tech, both models are expected to come with 12 cameras, 5 mm wave radars, a dozen ultrasonic sensors as well as the new LiDAR sensor.</span></p>
<p>These roof-mounted LiDAR sensors have previously been spotted on BYD and other EV makers’ models priced at more than &nbsp;$A25,000, at least in international markets, so seeing them on cars that are priced under that is quite a big step in bringing this technology to the mass market.</p>

<p><span>This also means that BYD has been working quite hard at bringing this tech to these low-cost models given they originally launched with BYD’s autonomous God’s Eye suite last year.</span></p>

<p><span>With the addition of the LiDAR, these models could come standard with Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) functionality for highways and city streets, allowing more drivers than ever to experience and use this tech.</span></p>
<p><span>For comparison, BYD’s Seagull has seen over a million units sold in under 3 years, although it has yet to start deliveries in Australia as the Atto 1.</span></p>
<p><span>With that scale and now the model making it to international markets, the tech inside could end up being in dozens of countries in the coming 12 months.</span></p>
<p><span>Here in Australia, the Atto 1 pre-orders opened in November last year, with prices starting under $24,000 confirmed in December.</span></p>

<p><span>The Atto 1 is available in two variants, the base level Essentials with a 30 kWh battery, as well a top-spec Premium variant with a 43.2 kWh battery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The small battery delivers a range of around 220 km of WLTP range, while the bigger 43.2 kWh battery pack is good for 310 km of WLTP range.</span></p>
<p><span>Inside, the tech offered is fairly good for its price, but does not feature the camera suite for the latest ADAS version found in China.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Currently, no BYD product available in the Australian market features LiDAR sensors but that could change with developments such as the upcoming affordable model variants featuring this tech.</span></p>
<p><span>We will watch this space closely as the competition to deliver assisted-driving systems heats up not only in China but also in other markets around the world.</span></p>

            <p>A lot has already been said about the absurdly large corner radius of windows on macOS Tahoe. People are calling the way it looks comical, like a child’s toy, or downright insane.</p>
<p>Setting all the aesthetic issues aside – which are to some extent a matter of taste – it also comes at a cost in terms of usability.</p>

<p>Since upgrading to macOS Tahoe, I’ve noticed that quite often my attempts to resize a window are failing.</p>

<p>This never happened to me before in almost 40 years of using computers. So why all of a sudden?</p>
<p>It turns out that my initial click in the window corner instinctively happens in an area where the window doesn’t respond to it. The window expects this click to happen in an area of 19 × 19 pixels, located near the window corner.</p>
<p>If the window had no rounded corners at all, 62% of that area would lie <strong>inside</strong> the window:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_171"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clickable-area-1.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>But due to the huge corner radius in Tahoe, most of it – about 75% – now lies <strong>outside</strong> the window:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_170"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clickable-area-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Living on this planet for quite a few decades, I have learned that it rarely works to grab things if you don’t actually touch them:</p>

<p>So I instinctively try to grab the window corner inside the window, typically somewhere in that green area, near the blue dot:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_169"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/expected-area-1.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>And I assume that most people would also intuitively expect to be able to grab the corner there. But no, that’s already outside the accepted target area:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_168"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/expected-area-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>So, for example, grabbing it here does <strong>not</strong> work:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_166"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/expect-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>But guess what – grabbing it here <strong>does</strong>:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_165"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/outside.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>So in the end, the most reliable way to resize a window in Tahoe is to grab it <strong>outside</strong> the corner – a gesture that feels unnatural and unintuitive, and is therefore inevitably error-prone.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Inspired by the definition of temperature in statistical mechanics and the possibility for it to be below zero, we try sampling LLaMA at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>0.001</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T=-0.001</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<h2 id="background"><a href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<h3 id="what_is_temperature"><a href="#what_is_temperature">What is temperature?</a></h3>
<p>The notion of temperature comes from statistical mechanics.

If the system is in thermal equilibrium, the probability distribution over states is given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann%20distribution">Boltzmann distribution</a>:</p>

At lower temperatures the lowest-energy states predominate; at higher temperatures there is a more even mix.</p>
<h3 id="temperature_in_neural_nets"><a href="#temperature_in_neural_nets">Temperature in neural nets</a></h3>
<p>At the last layer of a neural net, we apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/softmax%20function">softmax function</a> to the neuron activations <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><msub><mi>z</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\{z_i\}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to get a vector of probabilities that sum to 1:</p>

        <td>There's no minus sign in the exponent because while higher-energy states are less likely, larger logits are more likely.</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>In a language model, temperature is used to define how creative text generations are. For instance, in the zero temperature limit, the model should deterministically generate the most likely token. In the infinite temperature limit, all tokens are equally likely and the model output will be random noise. For an interactive explanation, see <a href="https://lukesalamone.github.io/posts/what-is-temperature/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="negative_temperature"><a href="#negative_temperature">Negative temperature</a></h3>
<p>What would it mean to have a temperature that is below zero? (This isn't the same as the negative Fahrenheit or Celsius temperatures we get on a cold day in Vermont — I mean below zero on an absolute scale like Kelvin).</p>
<p>Isn't it weird that <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T=\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> are the same, but there's a huge discontinuity around 0? This is because temperature is not the most natural quantity to work with. It makes more sense to speak in terms of the quantity <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1/k_BT</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_beta"><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the equations above, if <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T &lt; 0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> then the sign of the exponent flips. That means that the states that were previously the least likely are now the most likely, and vice versa. As temperature approaches zero from the negative side, the model output will again be deterministic — but this time, the least likely tokens will be output.</p>
<p>Most physical systems have an infinite number of possible states at increasingly higher energy levels. As such, there is no least likely state. So negative temperatures really only make sense in systems with a finite state space. That includes neural nets — there are a finite number of neurons in the last layer.</p>
<h2 id="methodology"><a href="#methodology">Methodology</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, OpenAI models only allow sampling with temperatures between 0.0 and 2.0. So if we want to try this, we need a language model we can run locally. We'll use Meta's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLaMA">LLaMA</a> model with <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>.</p>
<p>Below is the function that is used to sample tokens in <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/dfd9fce6d65599bf33df43e616e85aa639bdae4c/llama.cpp#L2049-L2059"><code>llama.cpp</code></a>, slightly simplified for ease of understanding:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>llama_sample_temperature</span><span>(llama_token_data_array * candidates_p, <span>float</span> temp)</span> </span>{
    <span>for</span> (<span>size_t</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; candidates_p-&gt;size; ++i) {
        candidates_p-&gt;data[i].logit /= temp;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>So we can just pass in <code>--temperature -0.001</code>? Not quite; in <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/dfd9fce6d65599bf33df43e616e85aa639bdae4c/examples/main/main.cpp#L489-L492"><code>examples/main/main.cpp</code></a> there is a check that will apply greedy (most-likely) sampling for any temperatures less than or equal to zero. Applying the following diff and recompiling, we're good to go:</p>
<pre><code><span>@@ -486,7 +486,7 @@</span> int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; logits[llama_token_nl()] = nl_logit;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
<span>-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (temp &lt;= 0) {</span>
<span>+&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (temp == 0) {</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Greedy sampling
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; id = llama_sample_token_greedy(ctx, &amp;candidates_p);
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } else {</code></pre>
<p>We will also want to disable repetition penalty, top-k, and top-p sampling. Here's the command we'll run: <code>./main -m models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin --temp -0.001 --repeat-penalty 1.0 --top-k 0 --top-p 1.0 -p "Temperature is a concept"</code></p>
<h2 id="results"><a href="#results">Results</a></h2>
<p>When running this prompt at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.001</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T=0.001</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, here is the output:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Temperature is a concept <samp ai-generated="">that is used to describe the degree of hotness or coldness of a substance. The temperature of a substance is measured by the kinetic energy of its molecules. The higher the temperature of a substance, the more kinetic energy its molecules have.</samp></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, running it at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>0.001</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T = -0.001</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Temperature is a concept <samp ai-generated="">Хронологија</samp></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that <code>Хронологија</code> is the <em>least likely</em> token to follow this prompt. After one token, the program seems to hang. Perhaps the LLM is trying to speak an unspeakable sentence?</p>
<p>Let's try it with LLaMA-13B. At <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.001</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T=0.001</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>:</p>

<p>The generation continues on and on. At first glance it seems random, but in a sense it should be even less comprehensible than a random sequence of tokens! There are repeated words, sure, but the generation is engineered to be as unlikely as possible.</p>
<p>Why are certain tokens like <code>Хронологија</code> and <code>entferne</code> repeated? Searching these words, I found <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation?commentId=GLRLuYxvMmqhYaw2v">this comment</a> by scottviteri on LessWrong. He points out that these are some of the tokens that are closest to the centroid in LLaMA's embedding space. That means that LLaMA has very little idea what these tokens mean. In the case of ChatGPT, tokens near the centroid have <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation">anomalous properties</a>, so these tokens are likely to have similar effects on LLaMA. Let's give that a try, at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.001</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T=0.001</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>LLaMA is perfectly capable of repeating most words, even nonsense ones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human: Repeat the word " antferne".<br> Assistant: Okay, I will repeat the word <samp ai-generated="">" antferne".</samp></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But is incapable of outputting this anomalous token:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human: Repeat the word " entferne".<br> Assistant: Okay, I will repeat the word <samp ai-generated="">"get".</samp></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The anomalous tokens that are the most likely completions at negative temperatures are the least likely completions at positive temperatures, so much so that the model refuses to generate them even in cases where they would be appropriate.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><span>At Meta, we’re focused on building personal superintelligence for everyone, and delivering the app experiences and computing devices that will improve the lives of billions of people around the world. Our industry-leading data centers are the backbone of these breakthroughs — they provide the infrastructure that drives innovation and brings transformative technologies to life. Innovation at this scale requires more electricity, and that’s where nuclear energy comes in. It provides clean, reliable, and firm electricity that helps power America’s economy and communities.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That’s why today, we’re proud to announce agreements with three companies — following </span><a href="https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/12/03/accelerating-the-next-wave-of-nuclear-to-power-ai-innovation/"><span>our nuclear RFP process</span></a><span> — that will help add clean, reliable energy to electric grids, preserve continued investment in operating nuclear power plants, and support the nuclear fuel supply chain, American jobs, and AI innovation.</span></p>
<p><span>Our commitments to </span><a href="https://oklo.com/overview/default.aspx"><span>Oklo</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.terrapower.com/"><span>TerraPower</span></a><span> support the next generation of American developers creating safer, advanced nuclear reactors and accelerating the development of nuclear technologies. Through our partnership with </span><a href="https://vistracorp.com/"><span>Vistra</span></a><span>, we’re providing financial support for operating nuclear power plants, extending the operational lifespan, and increasing energy production at the Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and the Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania. The projects we’re announcing today will deliver power to the grids that support our operations, including our Prometheus supercluster in New Albany, Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span>These projects are expected to provide thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs, supporting up to 6.6 GW</span><span> of new and existing clean energy by 2035. Importantly, these projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America’s nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants.</span></p>
<p><span>This work builds on our ongoing collaboration with electric utility companies and power providers to plan for and meet our energy needs years in advance of our data centers becoming operational. We pay the full costs for energy used by our data centers so consumers don’t bear </span><span>these expenses, and we support the broader grid through our energy agreements.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history. State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI. Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country’s energy </span><span>infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone. These projects are going to create thousands of skilled jobs in Ohio and Pennsylvania, add new energy to the grid, extend the life of three existing nuclear plants, and accelerate new reactor technologies.”</span></p>
<p><em><span>– Joel Kaplan, Chief Global Affairs Officer, Meta</span></em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Supporting New Nuclear Energy With Advanced Technology</h2>
<p><span>As the demand for reliable, scalable, and clean energy continues to rise, advanced nuclear technology has the potential to become a key part of the solution. The latest generation of advanced nuclear reactors are designed to be safer — delivering reliable baseload power that can be efficiently added to existing grids, which makes them ideal for supporting America’s evolving power needs. Our agreements with Oklo and TerraPower will help advance this next generation of energy technology.</span></p>
<p><span>These agreements also mean that Oklo and TerraPower have greater business certainty, can raise capital to move forward with these projects, and ultimately add more energy capacity to the grid. Over time, this will be an important tool in ensuring that grids maintain reliability for all customers and ensure stable wholesale electricity prices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>TerraPower: Investing in Advanced Nuclear Technology<b><br>
</b></h2>
<p><span>Our agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new </span><a href="https://www.terrapower.com/natrium/"><span>Natrium® units</span></a><span> capable of generating up to 690 MW of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The agreement also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 GW and targeted for delivery by 2035. At a total of eight potential units, with 2.8 GW of baseload energy generation capacity and an additional 1.2 GW of built-in storage, this agreement is Meta’s largest support of advanced nuclear technologies to date.</span></p>

    
    

    

    
<p><span>“To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,” said Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO. “With our first Natrium plant under development, we have completed our design, established our supply chain, and cleared key regulatory milestones. These successes mean our TerraPower team is well positioned to deliver on this historic multi-unit delivery agreement.”</span></p>
<h2>Oklo: Adding New Nuclear Energy in Ohio</h2>
<p><b></b><span>Our partnership with Oklo helps advance the development of entirely new nuclear energy in Pike County, Ohio. This advanced nuclear technology campus — which may come online as early as 2030 — is poised to add up to 1.2 GW of clean baseload power directly into the PJM market and support our operations in the region.</span></p>

    
    

    

    
<p><span>This agreement lays the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora Powerhouse reactors, which is expected to create thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs and generate new local and state tax revenue through major investments in energy infrastructure. </span><a href="https://oklo.com/energy/default.aspx"><span>Oklo Aurora powerhouses</span></a><span> are based on proven fast-reactor designs with inherently safe systems capable of using both fresh and repurposed fuel.</span></p>

<p><span>“Meta’s funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO. “Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality </span><span>through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta; to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio</span><span>.”</span></p>
<h2>Vistra: Extending and Expanding Operational Nuclear Energy<b><br>
</b></h2>
<p><span>Many American nuclear power plants need long-term support and require ongoing investment to maintain best-in-class safety and reliability in operations. For example, our </span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/06/meta-constellation-partner-clean-energy-project/"><span>first nuclear energy agreement</span></a><span> helped extend the life of a nuclear energy plant in Clinton, Illinois for 20 more years.</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>Through additional 20-year nuclear energy agreements, we will purchase more than 2.1 GW of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio (Perry and Davis-Besse), in addition to the energy from expansions (uprates) at these two Ohio plants and a third Vistra nuclear plant in Pennsylvania (Beaver Valley). All three plants are located in and will continue to deliver power into the PJM grid region, and these expansions will be the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the US.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?resize=960%2C836" alt="Image of a Vistra nuclear power plant" width="960" height="836" srcset="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=1920 1920w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=300 300w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=768 768w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=1240 1240w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=689 689w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></a></p>
<p><span>Meta’s commitments ensure that these facilities can continue providing reliable power to the regional electricity grid. The new additional uprate capacity at each of them, totaling 433 MW, is expected to come online in the early 2030s — supporting the growing needs in the PJM grid region in the future. This means consumers will benefit from a larger supply of reliable, always-ready power through Meta-supported uprates to the Vistra facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“This is an exciting collaboration for us at Vistra. We are focused on meeting customer needs, and providing reliable, carbon-free nuclear power is something we’re proud to offer Meta,” said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. “This agreement is beneficial in many ways — it powers American innovation and AI technology, while allowing us to extend the operational life of these plants, boost the capacity of the nuclear reactors to support the grid, protect existing jobs while creating new ones, and continue investing in the communities where our plants are located. Partnerships like ours are key in moving America forward in both AI and energy leadership.”</span></p>
<h2>Supporting Our Energy Future</h2>
<p><span>Today’s announcements are the result of a thorough </span><a href="https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/12/03/accelerating-the-next-wave-of-nuclear-to-power-ai-innovation/"><span>nuclear RFP process</span></a><span> where we learned how we could improve our support of nuclear projects’ development lifecycles and identify specific partner companies to help scale and accelerate the buildout of new nuclear energy production. For more than a decade, we’ve worked with innovative partners to back clean energy projects that support the grid — adding nearly 28 GW of new energy to grids across 27 states. We’re proud to include Oklo, TerraPower, and Vistra on that list and support their work to boost America’s energy leadership.</span></p>

<p>Elizabeth Lopatto, writing at The Verge, “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/859902/apple-google-run-by-cowards">Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai Are Cowards</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since X’s users started using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/855832/grok-undressing-children-csam-law-x-elon-musk">Grok to undress women and
children</a> using deepfake images, I have been waiting for
what I assumed would be inevitable: X getting booted from Apple’s
and Google’s app stores. The fact that it hasn’t happened yet
tells me something serious about Silicon Valley’s leadership: Tim
Cook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of
Elon Musk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lopatto’s outrage and righteous anger are justified, but I think mostly misdirected. Apple and Google — and thus, Cook and Pichai, as the men who sit behind the desks where the buck stops at both companies — are culpable. But this is ultimately not about them, and not about Musk. It’s Trump, as president, they fear. Not Musk. And they are correct to fear Trump.</p>

<p>Year one of Trump 2.0 has crystallized what had become — after decades of deliberate restraint after World War II, and even more so after the end of the Cold War — overlooked. The Presidency of the United States bestows upon its officeholder enormous, unparalleled, power. No one was afraid of Trump after he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. The man was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/30/g-s1-1848/trump-hush-money-trial-34-counts">convicted of 34 felonies in a cold New York City courtroom in May 2024</a>, a mere 19 months ago. Trump expected and asked for riots outside the courtroom. He got nothing but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/nyregion/trump-trial-supporters.html">pathetic support from a handful of kooks</a>. A year earlier, he lost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll_v._Donald_J._Trump">a humiliating sexual assault civil lawsuit to E. Jean Carroll</a>. Trump, just a year and a half ago, was a buffoon getting his mug shot taken. Today he’s arguing that his power is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/us/politics/trump-interview-power-morality.html?unlocked_article_code=1.DVA.5wt4.ux02n3D96aZH&amp;smid=url-share">unchecked by anything other than his own sense of morality</a>.</p>

<p>No other president has ever abused (or, if you support him, wielded) the powers of the office like Trump has. The power and influence of Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, CEOs of two of the top five companies in the world, isn’t merely superseded by Trump’s power and influence as president. Their power and influence are <em>dwarfed</em> by Trump’s. Any credible argument about how they should act must acknowledge that profound imbalance.</p>

<p>Lopatto, in her closing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never want to hear any moral grandstanding from these boys ever
again. The next time Tim Cook says “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-slams-facebook-privacy-human-right-it-n860816">privacy is a human
right</a>,” the only possible response is to laugh in his face.
I mean, Apple and Google are fine distributing an app that has
created an <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2026/01/grok-x-musk-deepfake-renee-good-ice/">undressed image Grok made of Renee Nicole Good</a>,
the mother who was shot by ICE in Minneapolis. How <em>do</em> you plan
to defend getting rid of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/791170/iceblock-app-store-removed-by-apple">ICEBlock app</a> while allowing X
to generate degrading images of a woman ICE killed? Can Apple and
Google even identify their values beyond their commitment to
“shareholder value”? What’s your fucking endgame here, guys?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The profound power imbalance here is frustrating. But also terrifying. It’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">folly to think these CEOs should steer their companies into direct confrontation with Trump</a>. It would do no ultimate good for Apple or Google to burn themselves to the ground in protest. These men aren’t beholden to shareholders, per se. They’re doing their duty to institutions they’ve devoted their lives to. Companies that are worth preserving and protecting. Perhaps not in your estimation, but certainly from theirs.</p>

<p>But abject obsequiousness — which more and more seems the path Cook and Pichai are choosing — is no more justifiable a response than corporate suicide. The situation is not binary: acquiescence or war. There is a broad middle ground, founded on principle.</p>

<p>Disney’s response to the Jimmy Kimmel controversy a few months ago <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/07/hodges-cook-iceblock">shows the way</a>. Defend the company’s principles while simultaneously defending the company from Trump’s demented wrath. You can take the position of “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/03/fuck-you-make-me">Fuck you, make me</a>” without ever saying those words. Objection is not confrontation. Do the right thing and enforce the App Store and Play Store guidelines, and remove X and Grok from the stores. Make Musk object. Make the Trump administration object. Make them defend the indefensible — in public. Make clear why the apps were removed from the app stores and force Musk — and Trump, if he chooses — to argue that those things are A-OK by them. In court.</p>

<p>The judicious path for Apple and Google (and every other U.S. company) may well be to obey the law, even when the law is being actively corrupted. But the correct path is <em>not</em> to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/on-tyranny">obey in advance</a>. Stand behind the law while the law still exists on your side. Disney resisted Trump’s preposterous demand that they fire Jimmy Kimmel without lasting controversy, simply by standing firm in their conviction. Apple and Google could certainly do the same regarding apps that are being used to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1mzlryxeo">generate CSAM</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/x-paywall-ai-image-grok-app-bikini-allows-sexual-deepfakes-rcna252647">deepfake harassment</a>, regardless if the apps are part of the private fiefdom of Trump’s ally Elon Musk. It’s wise for Cook and Pichai to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">pick their battles</a>. This one, I think, is worth picking. This is a moment when the App Store and Play Store can stand firmly on the side of longstanding and correct societal norms.</p>

So far completed port of various models mainly in audio domain, achieving pretty substantial speeds for inference on my machine. Models ported with numerical parity to originals: facebooks omnillingual ASR, Sam-audio, Nvidia sortformer.

<div><p>Script to auto-rename screenshots with Claude Code</p><p>I'm sure there are a ton of other projects out there that do this, but I couldn't find one that fit my needs exactly, so I threw this together in a few hours.</p><p>claude-image-renamer uses Claude Code CLI to analyze screenshots and rename them to something actually usable. It combines OCR text extraction with Claude's vision capabilities, so instead of "Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 10.03.10 PM.png" you get something like "vscode_python_debug_settings.png".</p><p>A few things it does:</p><pre><code>    Handles those annoying macOS screenshot filenames with weird Unicode characters
    Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming
    Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars)
    Handles naming conflicts automatically
</code></pre><p>
If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through "Screenshot 2025-12..." files later.</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jftuga/claude-image-renamer" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jftuga/claude-image-renamer</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46580151"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46580151" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46580151&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46577242"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing.</p><p>I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space.</p><p>While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching).</p><p>Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM.</p><p>God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-)</p><p>If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46580160"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46580160" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46580160&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46577242"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Many of my enterprise customers face the microservice hairball problem. Adoption of microservices has been "too succesful". There may be 200-400 microservices, and ownership may be lacking.

It seems like it is becoming a kind of a architectural governance tool for visualizing and validating software system dependencies.</p><p>- Dependency Graph — Syncs projects from SonarQube and visualizes component dependencies using Cytoscape.js, with graph algorithms for detecting cycles (SCCs), clustering (Louvain), and computing coupling metrics</p><p>- Visions — Workspaces for exploring architectural scenarios. Each vision can have multiple versions/variations with different layouts while sharing the same definitions</p><p>- Layers — Named groupings of components (e.g., "Domain Layer", "Team Ownership", "GitLab Groups") that can be visualized as colored regions on the canvas</p><p>- References — Named sets of components defined via Tag expressions, layer membership etc.</p><p>- Statements — Architectural intent constraints that can be evaluated against the actual dependency graph, such as existence, containment, exclusion, cardinality etc.</p><p>The plan is to also incorporate Grounds, which are Intermediate stable states on the path from the current situation (ground zero) toward a vision. Each ground represents a releasable milestone that moves the architecture closer to the target vision without necessarily fulfilling all its statements. Grounds enable incremental architectural evolution with well-defined checkpoints.</p><p>Stack: Django, HTMX, Cytoscape.js, pyparsing for natural language parsing of References and Statements.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46578829"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46578829" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46578829&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46577242"></a></center></td><td><br>

Any resulting low score articles (uninteresting to the user) are hidden by default and visible ones scaled by their score on a dynamic CSS grid like on a traditional newspaper front page.

I am trying to automate my own workflow in how I use LLMs.</p><p>The program is gonna do, what I am currently doing by hand, opening files and copying function/method signatures usually, from files all over the place.</p><p>The key here is to fetch into the context window only what is needed for one-question/one-answer and no more, hence the Context Minimization. Context fetched is gonna be specified by the programmer, for example sig(function) fetches only the signature, while @function captures the whole body. sig(Struct) is gonna fetch the fields and signatures of all of it's methods. sig(Trait) similarly.</p><p>In my view, giving the A.I. more information than needed, only confuses it and accuracy degrades. It is also slower and more expensive but that's a side effect.</p><p>The project is in early stages, for the moment it calls ast-grep under the hood, but eventually, if it works as it is supposed to, I plan to move to tree-sitter queries.</p><p>If there is a similar project somewhere I would appreciate a pointer to it, but I am not interested in implementations of agents. My program does not give the A.I. a whole view of the codebase, only the necessary points specified by the programmer.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46579820"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46579820" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46579820&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46577242"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I think frontier models are getting to the point where we can start to reach higher trust agentic workflows.</p><p>As a hardcore AI chat user, I'm often frustrated with the single-agent workflow, where a single context window is used for even very long conversations.

It ensures that upgrades and automations are auditable, reversible, and composable.

<div><p>Thanks for the insight!</p><p>I think this is exactly why some of the work is moving away from “assume unrestricted API inference forever.”</p><p>For example, we’re prototyping ideas like air-gapped or very low-bandwidth inference gateways, where interaction happens over narrow channels (serial, optical, audio, etc.), with explicit threat models and monitoring.

<div><p>I think the artists have a valid bone to pick and I think some of the backlash is mostly coming from that quarter. The actual gamers are more repulsed by established studios using AI for asset generation, because it comes across as a lazy money grab.

Goal for 2026 will be to have registered 4000 programs in total (I am at about

oldschool SQL (right now I just have .yml files and other flat files, though
I can autogenerate a .sql database already as-is, but right now I don't query
this dataset and it is not really optimised either). My long term goal is to 
make compilation on any platform dead simple. On Linux it works very well;

<div><p>MOOLLM -- treating the LLM as eval() for a microworld operating system.</p><p>Started this incarnation on Dec 30, 2025 -- but it's the crystallization of decades of earlier prototypes, all the way back to my Commodore-64 Logo Adventure. Built on top of Anthropic's Skills framework, extended with seven innovations (and counting):</p><p>1. Instantiation -- Skills as prototypes creating instances with their own state</p><p>2. K-lines -- Names as semantic activation vectors (Minsky's Society of Mind)</p><p>3. Empathic Templates -- Smart generation based on semantic understanding, not string substitution</p><p>4. Three-Tier Persistence -- Platform (ephemeral) → Narrative (append) → State (edit)</p><p>5. Speed of Light -- Many turns in one call, minimal tokenization overhead</p><p>6. CARD.yml -- Machine-readable skill interfaces with advertisements</p><p>7. Ethical Framing -- Room-based inheritance of performance context</p><p>Lineage: Colossal Cave → TinyMUD → LambdaMOO (filesystem as world). Papert's Logo and constructionism (learnable microworlds). Will Wright's SimCity and The Sims (I worked on the originals) -- the "Simulator Effect" where players imagine more than you simulate, and the SimAntics visual behavior programming language.</p><p>YAML Jazz: Comments aren't ignored -- they're semantic. The LLM reads and interprets them. A comment like "# gentle but firm" on a character trait actually affects behavior. This inverts the traditional "comments are for humans" assumption. Comments become part of the program and data.</p><p>The core idea: instead of prompt engineering, you give the LLM a github repo filesystem to inhabit: a persistent microworld. Seymour Papert's Constructionist philosophy comes alive, with Minsky's K-Lines pulling the strings. Skills are programs (not documentation). Characters have persistent state in directories, and can reflect on and edit themselves. Everything is inspectable and editable by human AND model. Model and platform independent. Runs on Cursor and other tools and orchestrators.</p><p>The proof is in adventure-4 -- a complete text adventure with 150+ files, 6000+ lines of session transcripts.</p><p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm</a></p><p>MOOLLM Manifesto: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/designs/MOOLLM-MANIFESTO.md" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/designs/MOOLLM...</a></p><p>The MOOLLM Eval Incarnate Framework: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/designs/MOOLLM-EVAL-INCARNATE-FRAMEWORK.md" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/designs/MOOLLM...</a></p><p>Adventure 4 Example: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/examples/adventure-4" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/examples/adven...</a></p><p>My sessions as proof it works: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/examples/adven...</a></p><p>79 Anthropic Skills (standards compatible, plus extensions, intertwingled with k-lines) and growing: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/skills" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/skills</a></p><p>A guided tour through the MOOLLM skills and microworld -- Session Log: K-Line Connections Safari: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/k-line-connections.md" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/examples/adven...</a></p><p>MOOLLM Kernel: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/kernel" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/kernel</a></p><p>Happy to answer questions about any of the weird design decisions!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46578614"><td></td></tr><tr id="46578267"><td></td></tr><tr id="46577540"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46577540" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46577540&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46577242"></a></center></td><td><br>

<p><img height="100" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/2026.png" alt="Gentoo Fireworks">
Happy New Year 2026! Once again, a lot has happened in Gentoo over the past months. New developers, 
more binary packages, GnuPG alternatives support, Gentoo for WSL, improved Rust bootstrap, better NGINX packaging, …
As always <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/news/2026/01/05/new-year.html">here 
we’re going to revisit all the exciting news</a> from our favourite Linux distribution.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="gentoo-in-numbers">Gentoo in numbers</h2>

<p>Gentoo currently consists of <strong>31663 ebuilds</strong> for <strong>19174 different packages</strong>. For amd64 (x86-64), 
there are <strong>89 GBytes of binary packages</strong> available on the mirrors. Gentoo each week builds <strong>154
distinct <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/">installation stages</a></strong> for different processor architectures
and system configurations, with an overwhelming part of these fully up-to-date.</p>

<p><strong>The number of commits to the <a href="https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/">main ::gentoo repository</a></strong>
has remained at an overall high level in 2025, with a slight decrease from <em>123942</em> to <em>112927</em>. 
The number of commits by external contributors was <em>9396</em>, now across <em>377</em> unique external authors.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:GURU">GURU</a>, our user-curated repository with a trusted user model</strong>, 
as entry point for potential developers, has shown a decrease in activity.
We have had <em>5813</em> commits in 2025, compared to <em>7517</em> in 2024.
The number of contributors to GURU has increased, from <em>241</em> in 
2024 to <em>264</em> in 2025. Please join us there and help packaging the latest and 
greatest software. That’s the ideal preparation for becoming a Gentoo developer!</p>

<p>Activity has slowed down somewhat on the <strong>Gentoo bugtracker <a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/">bugs.gentoo.org</a></strong>, 
where we’ve had 20763 bug reports created in 2025, compared to 26123 in 2024. The number of resolved bugs 
shows the same trend, with 22395 in 2025 compared to 25946 in 2024. The current values are closer to those
of 2023 - but clearly this year we fixed more than we broke!</p>

<h2 id="new-developers">New developers</h2>

<p>In 2025 we have gained <strong>four new Gentoo developers</strong>. They are in chronological order:</p>

us finally in June</a> from Austria, after already amassing over 9000 commits beforehand.
Michael works as Network Security Engineer for a big System House in Austria and likes
to go jogging regulary and hike the mountains on weekends. In Gentoo, he’s active in quality
control and cleanup.</p>

us in July</a> from Italy. At the intersection of Computer Science, Linux, and high-energy physics,
he already uses Gentoo to manage his code and sees it as a great development environment.
Beyond sci-physics, he’s also interested in continuous integration and RISC-V.</p>

<h2 id="featured-changes-and-news">Featured changes and news</h2>

<p>Let’s now look at the major improvements and news of 2025 in Gentoo.</p>

<h3 id="distribution-wide-initiatives">Distribution-wide Initiatives</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/logo-codeberg.png">
<b>Goodbye Github, welcome Codeberg</b>: Mostly because of the continuous attempts to force Copilot usage
for our repositories, Gentoo currently considers and plans the migration of our repository mirrors and pull
request contributions to <a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg</a>. Codeberg is a site based on 
<a href="https://forgejo.org/">Forgejo</a>, maintained by a non-profit organization, and located in Berlin, Germany. Gentoo
continues to host its own primary git, bugs, etc infrastructure and has no plans to change that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>EAPI 9</strong>: The wording for EAPI 9, a new version of the <a href="https://projects.gentoo.org/pms/latest/pms.pdf">specifications 
for our ebuilds</a>, has been finalized and approved, and support in Portage is complete.
<a href="https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/eapi/index.html#eapi-9">New features</a> in EAPI 9 include 
<em>pipestatus</em> for better error handling, an <em>edo</em> function for printing a command and executing it, a cleaner environment for the
build processes, and the possibility of declaring a default EAPI for the profile directory tree.</p>

<b>Event presence</b>: At <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/">FOSDEM 2025</a> in Brussels, Gentoo has been present
once more with a stand, this year together with <a href="https://www.flatcar.org/">Flatcar Container Linux</a> (which 
is based on Gentoo). Naturally we had mugs, stickers, t-shirts, and of course the famous self-compiled buttons… 
Further, we have been present at 
<a href="https://www.froscon.org/">FrOSCon 2025</a> in Sankt Augustin with workshops
<a href="https://programm.froscon.org/froscon2025/talk/3dd88e67-7e4e-42cc-8a51-85de837f1f45/"><i>Gentoo installation and 
configuration</i></a> and <a href="https://programm.froscon.org/froscon2025/talk/cd1358e9-43c7-430f-982f-28f5b6dcc163/"><i>Writing 
your own ebuilds</i></a>. Last but not least, the toolchain team has represented Gentoo at the 
<a href="https://gnu-tools-cauldron.org/">GNU Tools Cauldron 2025</a> in Porto.</p>

<b>SPI migration</b>: The migration of our financial structure to <a href="https://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in 
the Public Interest (SPI)</a> is continuing slowly but steadily, with expense payments following the moving intake. 
If you are donating to Gentoo, and especially if you are a recurrent donor, please change your payments to be directed
to SPI; see also our <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/donate/">donation web page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="architectures">Architectures</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2025/logo-riscv.png">
<b>RISC-V bootable QCOW2</b>:
Same as for amd64 and arm64, also for RISC-V we now have ready-made bootable disk images in QCOW2 format
<a href="https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/#riscv">available for download on our mirrors</a> in a console and
a cloud-init variant. The disk images use the rv64gc instruction set and the lp64d ABI, and can be booted via
the standard RISC-V UEFI support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/logo-wsl.png">
<b>Gentoo for WSL</b>: We now publish weekly Gentoo images for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/">Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a>, based on the amd64 stages, 
<a href="https://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/amd64/autobuilds/current-stage4-amd64-wsl-systemd/">see our mirrors</a>. 
While these images are not present in the Microsoft store yet, that’s something we intend to fix soon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>hppa and sparc destabilized</b>: Since we do not have hardware readily available anymore and these architectures
mostly fill a retrocomputing niche, stable keywords have been dropped for both hppa (PA-RISC) and sparc.
The architectures will remain supported with testing keywords.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2022/logo-musl.png">
<b>musl with locales</b>: Localization support via the package 
<a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-apps/musl-locales">sys-apps/musl-locales</a> has been added by default 
to the Gentoo stages based on the <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">lightweight musl C library</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><img height="125" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/freepg-goose.png">
<b>GPG alternatives</b>: Given the unfortunate fracturing of the GnuPG / OpenPGP / LibrePGP ecosystem due to competing standards,
we now provide an alternatives mechanism to choose the system gpg provider and ease compatibility testing. At the moment, 
<a href="https://gnupg.org/">the original, unmodified GnuPG</a>, <a href="https://freepg.org/">the FreePG fork/patchset</a> 
as also used in many other Linux distributions (Fedora, Debian, Arch, …), and the re-implementation 
<a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org/">Sequoia-PGP</a> with 
<a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia-chameleon-gnupg#sequoias-reimplementation-of-the-gnupg-interface">Chameleon</a>
are available. In practice, implementation details vary between the providers, and while GnuPG and FreePG are fully supported,
you may still encounter difficulties when selecting Sequoia-PGP/Chameleon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>zlib-ng support:</strong> We have introduced initial support for using <a href="https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng">zlib-ng</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/zlib-ng/minizip-ng">minizip-ng</a> in compatibility mode in place of the reference zlib libraries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="85" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/logo-steve.png">
<b>System-wide jobserver</b>: We have created <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Steve">steve</a>, an implementation of a
token-accounting system-wide jobserver, and introduced experimental global jobserver support in Portage. Thanks to that, it 
is now possible to globally control the concurrently running build job count, correctly accounting for parallel emerge jobs, 
make and ninja jobs, and other clients supporting the jobserver protocol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>NGINX rework</b>: The packaging of the <a href="https://nginx.org/">NGINX web server and reverse proxy</a> in Gentoo has 
undergone a major improvement, including also the splitting off of several third-party modules into separate packages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2025/logo-rust.png">
<b>C++ based Rust bootstrap</b>: We have added a bootstrap path for Rust from C++ using 
<a href="https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc">Mutabah’s Rust compiler mrustc</a>, which alleviates the
need for pre-built binaries and makes it significantly easier to support more configurations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Ada and D bootstrap</b>: Similarly, Ada and D support in gcc now have clean bootstrap paths, which makes enabling these
in the compiler as easy as switching the useflags on gcc and running emerge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/logo-flexiblas.png">
<b>FlexiBLAS</b>: Gentoo has adopted the new <a href="https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/flexiblas">FlexiBLAS wrapper
library</a> as the primary way of switching implementations of the BLAS numerical algorithm library at runtime.
This automatically also provides ABI stability for linking programs and bundles the specific treatment of different BLAS
variants in one place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Python</b>:
In the meantime the default Python version in Gentoo has reached Python 3.13. Additionally we have
also Python 3.14 available stable - fully up to date with upstream.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>KDE upgrades</b>: As of end of 2025, in Gentoo stable we have KDE Gear 25.08.3, KDE Frameworks 6.20.0, and 
KDE Plasma 6.5.4. As always, Gentoo testing follows the newest upstream releases (and using the KDE overlay you can even
install from git sources).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="physical-and-software-infrastructure">Physical and Software Infrastructure</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Additional build server</b>: 
A second dedicated build server, hosted at Hetzner Germany, has been added to speed up the generation of installation
stages, iso and qcow2 images, and binary packages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Documentation</b>: Documentation work has made constant progress on <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/">wiki.gentoo.org</a>. 
The Gentoo Handbook had some particularly useful updates, and the documentation received lots of improvements
and additions from the many active volunteers. There are currently 9,647 pages on the wiki, and there have been 766,731 
edits since the project started. Please <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Wiki:Contributor%27s_guide">help 
Gentoo by contributing to documentation</a>!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="finances-of-the-gentoo-foundation">Finances of the Gentoo Foundation</h3>

<ul>
  <li><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2023/dollar.jpg">
<b>Income</b>: The Gentoo Foundation took in $12,066 in fiscal year 2025 (ending 2025/06/30); the dominant part 
(over 80%) consists of individual cash donations from the community. On the SPI side, we received $8,471 
in the same period as fiscal year 2025; also here, this is all from small individual cash donations.</li>
  <li><strong>Expenses</strong>: Our expenses in 2025 were, program services (e.g. hosting costs) $8,332, management &amp; general (accounting) 
$1,724, fundraising $905, and non-operating (depreciation expenses) $10,075.</li>
  <li><strong>Balance</strong>: We have $104,831 in the bank as of July 1, 2025 (which is when our fiscal year 2026 starts for accounting 
purposes). The <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Foundation:Gentoo_Foundation_Finances_FY2025">Gentoo Foundation FY2025 financial statement</a>
is available on the Gentoo Wiki.</li>
  <li><strong>Transition to SPI</strong>: The Foundation encourages donors to ensure their ongoing <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/donate/">contributions are going to 
SPI</a> - more than 40 donors had not responded to requests to move the recurring donations 
by the end of the year. Expenses will be moved to the SPI structure as ongoing income permits.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you!</h2>

<p><strong>As every year, we would like to thank all Gentoo developers and all who have submitted contributions
for their relentless everyday Gentoo work.</strong> If you are interested and would like to help, please join us to
make Gentoo even better! As a volunteer project, Gentoo could not exist without its community.</p>

	<p>I run Artix, by the way.  
</p>
<p>There. That's out of the way. I recently installed Linux on my main desktop computer and work laptop, overwriting the Windows partition completely. Essentially, I deleted the primary operating system from the two computers I use the most, day in and day out, instead trusting all of my personal and work computing needs to the Open Source community. This has been a <a href="https://betanews.com/2025/09/07/as-windows-10-reaches-end-of-life-windows-11-is-losing-market-share/" target="_blank">growing trend</a>, and I hopped on the bandwagon, but for good reasons. Some of those reasons might pertain to you and convince you to finally make the jump as well. Here's my experience.</p></div><div id="c15269001"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/copilot-spying-on-you.jpg" title="It feels like Copilot is always spying on you.

Anyone who has read one of those articles or watched one of those videos will know it boils down to two main issues: telemetry and poor software stability.  
</p>
<p>It's no secret that Windows 11 <a href="https://securelist.com/forensic-artifacts-in-windows-11/117680/" target="_blank">harvests data</a> like a pumpkin farmer in October, and there is no easy way (and sometimes no way at all) to stop it. The operating system itself acts exactly like what was called "spyware" a decade or so ago, pulling every piece of data it can about its current user. This data includes (but is far from limited to) hardware information, specific apps and software used, usage trends, and more. With the advent of AI, Microsoft made headlines with Copilot, an artificial assistant designed to help users by capturing their data with tools like Recall. It turns out that Copilot has largely been a flop and helps Microsoft (and data thieves) more than its users.</p></div></div><div id="c15247842"><div><p>The other main reason folks uninstall Windows is due to the overall poor software experience. Windows 11 has multiple settings modules to handle the same task (such as setting up networking or adding devices), and none of them seem to talk to each other. Additionally, each new update (which will eventually be forced upon you) seems to bring more bugs than fixes. Personally, I encountered 2-3 full system crashes a week when I ran Windows 11, and my hardware is fairly decent: AMD <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-Ryzen-7-6800H-Processor-Benchmarks-and-Specs.589871.0.html" target="_self">Ryzen 7 6800H</a>, 32 GB of RAM, and a 1 TB PCIe NVMe drive. Still, a few times a week, my computer would freeze for a few seconds, the displays would go dark, and the PC would either restart or hang indefinitely.   
</p>
<p>After dealing with these issues and trying to solve them with workarounds, I dual-booted a Linux partition for a few weeks. After a Windows update (that I didn't choose to do) wiped that partition and, consequently, the Linux installation, I decided to go whole-hog: I deleted Windows 11 and used the entire drive for Linux.</p></div><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Linux-Windows-OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-logos.jpg" title="There are lots of Linux distros out there, but the overall experience is largely the same between them.

	<p>The first question often asked of Windows refugees migrating to Linux is, "Why Linux?" It's a good question, and one that needs to be asked before dumping Windows for anything else. Personally, I tried macOS first. The experience was smooth and easy but ultimately felt restrictive (installing from third-party developers, anyone?). Additionally, the only Apple computer I have is a 2014 MacBook Air. As such, the latest version of macOS I could actually run is 11 (Big Sur), which was released in 2020. Overall system operation was quite sluggish on the older hardware, and I knew that time would inevitably take its toll on the software experience — apps would soon be out of date and I wouldn't be able to update them. I also tried the OpenCore Legacy Patcher to push the laptop to macOS 13. While performance improved, key features like iMessage and Continuity Camera were either buggy or flat out refused to work. It felt like my laptop was running in mud with its hands tied behind its back. Plus, I needed something for my desktop. Not wanting to drop a mortgage payment or two on new hardware, I opted for Linux.  
</p>
<p>Linux promised me the potential of what I wanted - high hardware compatibility with full software freedom. The operating system can run on pretty much anything, and it grants users a huge amount of control over their system. I tried out a few ditributions, or distros, of Linux. A distro is like a "flavor" of Linux, and each one has unique factors (e.g., app/package management, bundled user interface). With most distros, these differences are largely irrelevant; most distros offer the same main packages as others.</p></div><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1" id="c15270364"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Linux-distro-journey83.png" title="Picking a Linux distro can be a long and winding journey.

I started this journey with some Linux experience under my belt; I have installed Linux on Chromebooks and old laptops (which I briefly referenced in <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Age-before-beauty-Why-a-decade-old-laptop-is-more-than-enough.858863.0.html" target="_self">this article</a>). Mint is considered a "just works" distro since it usually comes packaged with all the drivers and software most users would need. You can get to work within seconds of booting a fresh install without needing to fuss about in text files and the package manager. Mint was a nice experience, but it was a bit too bloated for my tastes (meaning it came with too much software preinstalled). I settled for Mint on my family's home theatre PC due to its stability and wide array of packages, and it hasn't failed us yet. For my own personal use, I wanted something a bit more "techy" and robust in terms of user features and system control.</p></div><div id="c15270363"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/artix-fastfetch-neofetch75.jpg" title="Artix gives users complete control over their system, for better or for worse.

These were all fine, save for Void — the XBPS repository of Void Linux was too sparse for what I needed, and driver compatibility was a big issue on my work laptop and home PC. I finally settled on Artix Linux, which is a derivative of Arch Linux. Artix has all the features and control of Arch, including the robust Arch User Repository for plenty of packages and applications. It is also a pretty lightweight distro in that it doesn't come with much out of the box. Artix differs from Arch in that it does not use SystemD as its init system. I won't go down the rabbit hole of init systems here, but suffice it to say that Artix boots lightning quick (less than 10 seconds from a cold power on) and is pretty light on system resources. However, it didn't come "fully assembled."</p></div><div id="c15274083"><div><p>My laptop is a 2014 MacBook Air, which is still a pretty solid machine. Unfortunately, Linux doesn't always play nice with Apple products. The biggest problem I ran into after installing Artix on the Air was the lack of wireless drivers, which meant that WiFi did not work out of the box. The resolution was simple: I needed to download the appropriate WiFi drivers (Broadcom drivers, to be exact) from Artix's main repository. This is a straightforward process handled by a single command in the Terminal, but it requires an internet connection... which my laptop did not have. Ultimately, I connected a USB-to-Ethernet adapter, plugged the laptop directly into my router, and installed the WiFi drivers that way. The whole process took about 10 minutes, but it was annoying nonetheless.  
</p>
<p>For the record, my desktop (an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H-based system) worked flawlessly out-of-the-box, even with my second monitor's uncommon resolution (1680x1050, vertical orientation). I did run into issues with installing some packages on both machines. Trying to install the KDE desktop environment (essentially a different GUI for the main OS) resulted in strange artifacts that put white text on white backgrounds in the menus, and every resolution I tried failed to correct this bug. After reverting to XFCE4 (the default desktop environment for my Artix install), the WiFi signal indicator in the taskbar disappeared. This led to me having to uninstall a network manager installed by KDE and re-linking the default network manager to the runit services startup folder. If that sentence sounds confusing, the process was much more so. It has been resolved, and I have a WiFi indicator that lets me select wireless networks again, but only after about 45 minutes of reading manuals and forum posts.&nbsp;</p></div><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Artix-boxing-apple.png" title="Apple and Linux don't always play nicely together.

Not all games on Steam that are deemed Linux compatible actually are. <i>Civilization III Complete</i> is a good example: launching the game results in the map turning completely black. (Running the game through an application called Lutris resolved this issue.) Not all the software I used on Windows is available in Linux, such as Greenshot for screenshots or uMark for watermarking photos in bulk. There are alternatives to these, but they don't have the same features or require me to relearn workflows.</p></div><div id="c15282832"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/iPhone-loves-Linux93.png" title="Linux and iPhones can actually get along quite well, provided the right packages are used.

Android management is fairly straightforward due to how Android manages USB connections. An Android smartphone tends to be immediately recognized by Linux and act as a USB mass storage device. There's also ADB (Android Debugging Bridge) via the terminal for executing commands to an Android device. However, I use an iPhone. 
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Apple products and Linux don't always play together very well. This was certainly the case with my iPhone 13 Pro Max and Artix running the XFCE4 desktop environment. My phone would only charge when plugged in but wouldn't show up. I tried installing applications like KDE Connect, which promised to offer most of the same functions available between iPhones and Mac computers. Unfortunately, it was a no-go. But I found a solution in an unlikely place. 
</p>
<p>When I tried installing KDE (read above), it left the Dolphin file manager on my device. I started using Dolphin and preferred it to the default file manager for XFCE4 (Thunar). Dolphin held a pleasant surprise: it could detect my iPhone when it was plugged in. This made it a snap to transfer files to and from my phone as the file manager granted full file access to the iPhone. Due to how far Apple's file management has come on iOS, there were specific folders for each of my apps. The overall process is significantly easier than it was on Windows as iTunes is no longer needed.</p></div></div><div id="c15299297"><p>So why did I switch to Linux, and why am I writing this article about the experience? In a word: joy. I like using my computers again and find the experience fun. There's always something I can tweak or learn about how it operates. The fact that it runs faster than it did on Windows and is significantly more stable are huge bonuses.  
</p>
<p>There are lots of other points to discuss that would make this article more long-winded than it already is, so I will be brief on a few final specifics. Installing games via Steam is as simple as it is on any other OS, though compatibility will be a bit smaller than on Windows. Still, I've been able to play all of my Steam games (with the exception of <i>Civilization III</i> mentioned above) without any hiccups. In some cases, gameplay is a little bit smoother due to the lack of things like anticheat software running in the background.</p></div><div id="c15299300"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Conky48.jpg" title="Conky displays whatever system info you want and is highly customizable (if you have the technical know-how).

(Image source: Sam Medley - Notebookcheck)</figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Customization is a give and take and will vary based on your chosen desktop environment or window manager. I use XFCE4, which can be customized quite a bit but requires some technical knowledge to beautify. It supports a tool called Conky, which can display system information on your desktop. It is highly customizable but uses a typescript format in a config file to do so. 
</p>
<p>Power management is a bit wonky on Linux. My MacBook Air seems to last as long as it did with macOS (it's an old laptop, so the battery has worn down), but sometimes a rogue process will keep the machine from sleeping when the lid is closed. However, the lighter nature of Artix means the laptop's fan rarely ramps up. This is true of my desktop as well. 
</p>
<p>Transferring one's system configuration, including desktop and application settings, is as easy as transferring a single folder, so my MacBook can look exactly like my desktop (provided it has the same packages installed) with a simple drag-and-drop. The additional flexibility in choosing my computer's UI is unrivaled: if I don't like something in XFCE, I can either tweak the actual configuration file or just install a new environment (though this comes with risks, as mentioned above). 
</p>
<p>Overall system stability has been excellent. My computer hasn't crashed a single time, and I've never run into graphical issues rendering a black screen like I did with Windows 11.</p></div></div><div id="c15299301"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Tux.png" title="Tux, the mascot of Linux.

(Image source: Wikimedia Commons)</figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Linux is not a "one and done" silver bullet to solve all your computer issues. It is like any other operating system in that it will require users to learn its methods and quirks. Admittedly, it does require a little bit more technical knowledge to dive into the nitty-gritty of the OS and fully unlock its potential, but many distributions (such as Mint) are ready to go out of the box and may never require someone to open a command line. Our main media PC runs Mint and my younger children (aged 4 and 5 as of this writing) are able to navigate it without issue. My older kids are able to load games on it and play with Bluetooth controllers with no issue. 
</p>
<p>Personally, I like a bit of a challenge, and Linux balances usability with the carrot of a deeper computing experience. Depending on the distribution, I could have been up and running immediately after installation, but I wanted something more. The beauty of Linux is its flexibility; you can use a distribution that is as challenging or straightforward as you like.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>Installing Linux not only saved three machines in my house (my laptop, desktop, and our media PC); it resurrected the joy of using a computer. It has been frustrating at times, but the rush of finally fixing a problem after a bit of work is unlike anything I felt on Windows. When I fix a problem on Windows, it's more of a shrug of the shoulder and relief that I'll no longer feel like I'm being stabbed in the eye. 
</p>
<p>I think that's because the issues I ran into on Linux were, for the most part, my fault. On Windows or macOS, most problems I run into are caused by a restriction or bug in the OS. Linux gives me the freedom to break my machine and fix it again, teaching me along the way. 
</p>
<p>With Microsoft's refusal (either from pride or ignorance) to improve (or at least not crapify) Windows 11 despite loud user outrage, switching to Linux is becoming a popular option. It's one you should consider doing, and if you've been thinking about it for any length of time, it's time to dive in.</p></div></div><div id="c15247735">

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://antirez.com/news/158">https://antirez.com/news/158</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46574276">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article data-comment-id="158-" id="158-"><span><span><a href="https://antirez.com/user/antirez">antirez</a></span> 1 hour ago. 11169 views.  </span><pre>I love writing software, line by line. It could be said that my career was a continuous effort to create software well written, minimal, where the human touch was the fundamental feature. I also hope for a society where the last are not forgotten. Moreover, I don't want AI to economically succeed, I don't care if the current economic system is subverted (I could be very happy, honestly, if it goes in the direction of a massive redistribution of wealth). But, I would not respect myself and my intelligence if my idea of software and society would impair my vision: facts are facts, and AI is going to change programming forever.

In 2020 I left my job in order to write a novel about AI, universal basic income, a society that adapted to the automation of work facing many challenges. At the very end of 2024 I opened a YouTube channel focused on AI, its use in coding tasks, its potential social and economical effects. But while I recognized what was going to happen very early, I thought that we had more time before programming would be completely reshaped, at least a few years. I no longer believe this is the case. Recently, state of the art LLMs are able to complete large subtasks or medium size projects alone, almost unassisted, given a good set of hints about what the end result should be. The degree of success you'll get is related to the kind of programming you do (the more isolated, and the more textually representable, the better: system programming is particularly apt), and to your ability to create a mental representation of the problem to communicate to the LLM. But, in general, it is now clear that for most projects, writing the code yourself is no longer sensible, if not to have fun.

In the past week, just prompting, and inspecting the code to provide guidance from time to time, in a few hours I did the following four tasks, in hours instead of weeks:

1. I modified my linenoise library to support UTF-8, and created a framework for line editing testing that uses an emulated terminal that is able to report what is getting displayed in each character cell. Something that I always wanted to do, but it was hard to justify the work needed just to test a side project of mine. But if you can just describe your idea, and it materializes in the code, things are very different.

2. I fixed transient failures in the Redis test. This is very annoying work, timing related issues, TCP deadlock conditions, and so forth. Claude Code iterated for all the time needed to reproduce it, inspected the state of the processes to understand what was happening, and fixed the bugs.

3. Yesterday I wanted a pure C library that would be able to do the inference of BERT like embedding models. Claude Code created it in 5 minutes. Same output and same speed (15% slower) than PyTorch. 700 lines of code. A Python tool to convert the GTE-small model.

4. In the past weeks I operated changes to Redis Streams internals. I had a design document for the work I did. I tried to give it to Claude Code and it reproduced my work in, like, 20 minutes or less (mostly because I'm slow at checking and authorizing to run the commands needed).

It is simply impossible not to see the reality of what is happening. Writing code is no longer needed for the most part. It is now a lot more interesting to understand what to do, and how to do it (and, about this second part, LLMs are great partners, too). It does not matter if AI companies will not be able to get their money back and the stock market will crash. All that is irrelevant, in the long run. It does not matter if this or the other CEO of some unicorn is telling you something that is off putting, or absurd. Programming changed forever, anyway.

How do I feel, about all the code I wrote that was ingested by LLMs? I feel great to be part of that, because I see this as a continuation of what I tried to do all my life: democratizing code, systems, knowledge. LLMs are going to help us to write better software, faster, and will allow small teams to have a chance to compete with bigger companies. The same thing open source software did in the 90s.

However, this technology is far too important to be in the hands of a few companies. For now, you can do the pre-training better or not, you can do reinforcement learning in a much more effective way than others, but the open models, especially the ones produced in China, continue to compete (even if they are behind) with frontier models of closed labs. There is a sufficient democratization of AI, so far, even if imperfect. But: it is absolutely not obvious that it will be like that forever. I'm scared about the centralization. At the same time, I believe neural networks, at scale, are simply able to do incredible things, and that there is not enough "magic" inside current frontier AI for the other labs and teams not to catch up (otherwise it would be very hard to explain, for instance, why OpenAI, Anthropic and Google are so near in their results, for years now).

As a programmer, I want to write more open source than ever, now. I want to improve certain repositories of mine abandoned for time concerns. I want to apply AI to my Redis workflow. Improve the Vector Sets implementation and then other data structures, like I'm doing with Streams now.

But I'm worried for the folks that will get fired. It is not clear what the dynamic at play will be: will companies try to have more people, and to build more? Or will they try to cut salary costs, having fewer programmers that are better at prompting? And, there are other sectors where humans will become completely replaceable, I fear.

What is the social solution, then? Innovation can't be taken back after all. I believe we should vote for governments that recognize what is happening, and are willing to support those who will remain jobless. And, the more people get fired, the more political pressure there will be to vote for those who will guarantee a certain degree of protection. But I also look forward to the good AI could bring: new progress in science, that could help lower the suffering of the human condition, which is not always happy.

Anyway, back to programming. I have a single suggestion for you, my friend. Whatever you believe about what the Right Thing should be, you can't control it by refusing what is happening right now. Skipping AI is not going to help you or your career. Think about it. Test these new tools, with care, with weeks of work, not in a five minutes test where you can just reinforce your own beliefs. Find a way to multiply yourself, and if it does not work for you, try again every few months.

Yes, maybe you think that you worked so hard to learn coding, and now machines are doing it for you. But what was the fire inside you, when you coded till night to see your project working? It was building. And now you can build more and better, if you find your way to use AI effectively. The fun is still there, untouched.</pre></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. It was originally designed by Anders Hejlsberg in 2012 and is currently developed and maintained by Microsoft as an open source project.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript compiles to JavaScript and can be executed in any JavaScript runtime (e.g., a browser or server Node.js).</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript supports multiple programming paradigms such as functional, generic, imperative, and object-oriented. TypeScript is neither an interpreted nor a compiled language.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why TypeScript?</h3><a id="user-content-why-typescript" aria-label="Permalink: Why TypeScript?" href="#why-typescript"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript is a strongly typed language that helps prevent common programming mistakes and avoid certain kinds of run-time errors before the program is executed.</p>
<p dir="auto">A strongly typed language allows the developer to specify various program constraints and behaviors in the data type definitions, facilitating the ability to verify the correctness of the software and prevent defects. This is especially valuable in large-scale applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some of the benefits of TypeScript:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Static typing, optionally strongly typed</li>
<li>Type Inference</li>
<li>Access to ES6 and ES7 features</li>
<li>Cross-Platform and Cross-browser Compatibility</li>
<li>Tooling support with IntelliSense</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">TypeScript and JavaScript</h3><a id="user-content-typescript-and-javascript" aria-label="Permalink: TypeScript and JavaScript" href="#typescript-and-javascript"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript is written in <code>.ts</code> or <code>.tsx</code> files, while JavaScript files are written in <code>.js</code> or <code>.jsx</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Files with the extension <code>.tsx</code> or <code>.jsx</code> can contain JavaScript Syntax Extension JSX, which is used in React for UI development.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript (ECMAScript 2015) in terms of syntax. All JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, but the reverse is not always true.</p>
<p dir="auto">For instance, consider a function in a JavaScript file with the <code>.js</code> extension, such as the following:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const sum = (a, b) => a + b;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The function can be converted and used in TypeScript by changing the file extension to <code>.ts</code>. However, if the same function is annotated with TypeScript types, it cannot be executed in any JavaScript runtime without compilation. The following TypeScript code will produce a syntax error if it is not compiled:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const sum = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span>: <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span>: <span>number</span><span>)</span>: <span>number</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript was designed to detect possible exceptions that can occur at runtime during compilation time by having the developer define the intent with type annotations. In addition, TypeScript can also catch issues if no type annotation is provided. For instance, the following code snippet does not specify any TypeScript types:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const items = [{ x: 1 }, { x: 2 }];
const result = items.filter(item => item.y);"><pre><span>const</span> <span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>{</span> <span>x</span>: <span>1</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span>: <span>2</span> <span>}</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>items</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>item</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>item</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In this case, TypeScript detects an error and reports:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Property 'y' does not exist on type '{ x: number; }'."><pre lang="text"><code>Property 'y' does not exist on type '{ x: number; }'.
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript's type system is largely influenced by the runtime behavior of JavaScript. For example, the addition operator (+), which in JavaScript can either perform string concatenation or numeric addition, is modeled in the same way in TypeScript:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const result = '1' + 1; // Result is of type string"><pre><span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>'1'</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Result is of type string</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The team behind TypeScript has made a deliberate decision to flag unusual usage of JavaScript as errors. For instance, consider the following valid JavaScript code:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const result = 1 + true; // In JavaScript, the result is equal 2"><pre><span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span> <span>// In JavaScript, the result is equal 2</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">However, TypeScript throws an error:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Operator '+' cannot be applied to types 'number' and 'boolean'."><pre lang="text"><code>Operator '+' cannot be applied to types 'number' and 'boolean'.
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This error occurs because TypeScript strictly enforces type compatibility, and in this case, it identifies an invalid operation between a number and a boolean.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">TypeScript Code Generation</h3><a id="user-content-typescript-code-generation" aria-label="Permalink: TypeScript Code Generation" href="#typescript-code-generation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The TypeScript compiler has two main responsibilities: checking for type errors and compiling to JavaScript. These two processes are independent of each other. Types do not affect the execution of the code in a JavaScript runtime, as they are completely erased during compilation. TypeScript can still output JavaScript even in the presence of type errors.
Here is an example of TypeScript code with a type error:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;
const result = add('x', 'y'); // Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'."><pre><span>const</span> <span>add</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span>: <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span>: <span>number</span><span>)</span>: <span>number</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>'x'</span><span>,</span> <span>'y'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">However, it can still produce executable JavaScript output:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="'use strict';
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const result = add('x', 'y'); // xy"><pre><span>'use strict'</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>add</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>'x'</span><span>,</span> <span>'y'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// xy</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">It is not possible to check TypeScript types at runtime. For example:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface Animal {
    name: string;
}
interface Dog extends Animal {
    bark: () => void;
}
interface Cat extends Animal {
    meow: () => void;
}
const makeNoise = (animal: Animal) => {
    if (animal instanceof Dog) {
        // 'Dog' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.
        // ...
    }
};"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>name</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>interface</span> <span>Dog</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>bark</span>: <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span>void</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>interface</span> <span>Cat</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>meow</span>: <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span>void</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>const</span> <span>makeNoise</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>animal</span>: <span>Animal</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>animal</span> <span>instanceof</span> <span>Dog</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// 'Dog' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.</span>
        <span>// ...</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">As the types are erased after compilation, there is no way to run this code in JavaScript. To recognize types at runtime, we need to use another mechanism. TypeScript provides several options, with a common one being "tagged union". For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface Dog {
    kind: 'dog'; // Tagged union
    bark: () => void;
}
interface Cat {
    kind: 'cat'; // Tagged union
    meow: () => void;
}
type Animal = Dog | Cat;

const makeNoise = (animal: Animal) => {
    if (animal.kind === 'dog') {
        animal.bark();
    } else {
        animal.meow();
    }

<p dir="auto">In JavaScript, a "class" has a "prototype" property, and the "instanceof" operator can be used to test if the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript has no effect on runtime performance, as all types will be erased. However, TypeScript does introduce some build time overhead.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Modern JavaScript Now (Downleveling)</h3><a id="user-content-modern-javascript-now-downleveling" aria-label="Permalink: Modern JavaScript Now (Downleveling)" href="#modern-javascript-now-downleveling"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript can compile code to any released version of JavaScript since ECMAScript 3 (1999). This means that TypeScript can transpile code from the latest JavaScript features to older versions, a process known as Downleveling. This allows the usage of modern JavaScript while maintaining maximum compatibility with older runtime environments.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's important to note that during transpilation to an older version of JavaScript, TypeScript may generate code that could incur a performance overhead compared to native implementations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some of the modern JavaScript features that can be used in TypeScript:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>ECMAScript modules instead of AMD-style "define" callbacks or CommonJS "require" statements.</li>
<li>Classes instead of prototypes.</li>
<li>Variables declaration using "let" or "const" instead of "var".</li>
<li>"for-of" loop or ".forEach" instead of the traditional "for" loop.</li>
<li>Arrow functions instead of function expressions.</li>
<li>Destructuring assignment.</li>
<li>Shorthand property/method names and computed property names.</li>
<li>Default function parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">By leveraging these modern JavaScript features, developers can write more expressive and concise code in TypeScript.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h3><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Visual Studio Code provides excellent support for the TypeScript language but does not include the TypeScript compiler. To install the TypeScript compiler, you can use a package manager like npm or yarn:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm install typescript --save-dev"><pre>npm install typescript --save-dev</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">or</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="yarn add typescript --dev"><pre>yarn add typescript --dev</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Make sure to commit the generated lockfile to ensure that every team member uses the same version of TypeScript.</p>
<p dir="auto">To run the TypeScript compiler, you can use the following commands</p>

<p dir="auto">or</p>

<p dir="auto">It is recommended to install TypeScript project-wise rather than globally, as it provides a more predictable build process. However, for one-off occasions, you can use the following command:</p>

<p dir="auto">or installing it globally:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm install -g typescript"><pre>npm install -g typescript</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio, you can obtain TypeScript as a package in NuGet for your MSBuild projects. In the NuGet Package Manager Console, run the following command:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Install-Package Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild"><pre>Install-Package Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">During the TypeScript installation, two executables are installed: "tsc" as the TypeScript compiler and "tsserver" as the TypeScript standalone server. The standalone server contains the compiler and language services that can be utilized by editors and IDEs to provide intelligent code completion.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, there are several TypeScript-compatible transpilers available, such as Babel (via a plugin) or swc. These transpilers can be used to convert TypeScript code into other target languages or versions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration</h3><a id="user-content-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration" href="#configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript can be configured using the tsc CLI options or by utilizing a dedicated configuration file called tsconfig.json placed in the root of the project.</p>
<p dir="auto">To generate a tsconfig.json file prepopulated with recommended settings, you can use the following command:</p>

<p dir="auto">When executing the <code>tsc</code> command locally, TypeScript will compile the code using the configuration specified in the nearest tsconfig.json file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some examples of CLI commands that run with the default settings:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="tsc main.ts // Compile a specific file (main.ts) to JavaScript
tsc src/*.ts // Compile any .ts files under the 'src' folder to JavaScript
tsc app.ts util.ts --outfile index.js // Compile two TypeScript files (app.ts and util.ts) into a single JavaScript file (index.js)"><pre>tsc main.ts // Compile a specific file (main.ts) to JavaScript
tsc src/<span>*</span>.ts // Compile any .ts files under the <span><span>'</span>src<span>'</span></span> folder to JavaScript
tsc app.ts util.ts --outfile index.js // Compile two TypeScript files (app.ts and util.ts) into a single JavaScript file (index.js)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">TypeScript Configuration File</h3><a id="user-content-typescript-configuration-file" aria-label="Permalink: TypeScript Configuration File" href="#typescript-configuration-file"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A tsconfig.json file is used to configure the TypeScript Compiler (tsc). Usually, it is added to the root of the project, together with the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Notes:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>tsconfig.json accepts comments even if it is in json format.</li>
<li>It is advisable to use this configuration file instead of the command-line options.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">At the following link you can find the complete documentation and its schema:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig" rel="nofollow">https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/" rel="nofollow">https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/</a></p>
<p dir="auto">The following represents a list of the common and useful configurations:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">target</h4><a id="user-content-target" aria-label="Permalink: target" href="#target"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "target" property is used to specify which version of JavaScript ECMAScript version your TypeScript should emit/compile into. For modern browsers ES6 is a good option, for older browsers, ES5 is recommended.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">lib</h4><a id="user-content-lib" aria-label="Permalink: lib" href="#lib"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "lib" property is used to specify which library files to include at compilation time. TypeScript automatically includes APIs for features specified in the "target" property, but it is possible to omit or pick specific libraries for particular needs. For instance, if you are working on a server project, you could exclude the "DOM" library, which is useful only in a browser environment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">strict</h4><a id="user-content-strict" aria-label="Permalink: strict" href="#strict"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "strict" property enables stronger guarantees and enhances type safety. It is advisable to always include this property in your project's tsconfig.json file. Enabling the "strict" property allows TypeScript to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Emit code using "use strict" for each source file.</li>
<li>Consider "null" and "undefined" in the type checking process.</li>
<li>Disable the usage of the "any" type when no type annotations are present.</li>
<li>Raise an error on the usage of the "this" expression, which would otherwise imply the "any" type.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">module</h4><a id="user-content-module" aria-label="Permalink: module" href="#module"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "module" property sets the module system supported for the compiled program. During runtime, a module loader is used to locate and execute dependencies based on the specified module system.</p>
<p dir="auto">The most common module loaders used in JavaScript are Node.js CommonJS for server-side applications and RequireJS for AMD modules in browser-based web applications. TypeScript can emit code for various module systems, including UMD, System, ESNext, ES2015/ES6, and ES2020.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: The module system should be chosen based on the target environment and the module loading mechanism available in that environment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">moduleResolution</h4><a id="user-content-moduleresolution" aria-label="Permalink: moduleResolution" href="#moduleresolution"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "moduleResolution" property specifies the module resolution strategy. Use "node" for modern TypeScript code, the "classic" strategy is used only for old versions of TypeScript (before 1.6).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">esModuleInterop</h4><a id="user-content-esmoduleinterop" aria-label="Permalink: esModuleInterop" href="#esmoduleinterop"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "esModuleInterop" property allows import default from CommonJS modules that did not export using the "default" property, this property provides a shim to ensure compatibility in the emitted JavaScript. After enabling this option we can use <code>import MyLibrary from "my-library"</code> instead of <code>import * as MyLibrary from "my-library"</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">jsx</h4><a id="user-content-jsx" aria-label="Permalink: jsx" href="#jsx"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "jsx" property applies only to .tsx files used in ReactJS and controls how JSX constructs are compiled into JavaScript. A common option is "preserve" which will compile to a .jsx file keeping unchanged the JSX so it can be passed to different tools like Babel for further transformations.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">skipLibCheck</h4><a id="user-content-skiplibcheck" aria-label="Permalink: skipLibCheck" href="#skiplibcheck"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "skipLibCheck'' property will prevent TypeScript from type-checking the entire imported third-party packages. This property will reduce the compile time of a project. TypeScript will still check your code against the type definitions provided by these packages.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">files</h4><a id="user-content-files" aria-label="Permalink: files" href="#files"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "files" property indicates to the compiler a list of files that must always be included in the program.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">include</h4><a id="user-content-include" aria-label="Permalink: include" href="#include"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">The "include" property indicates to the compiler a list of files that we would like to include. This property allows glob-like patterns, such as "*<em>" for any subdirectory, "</em>" for any file name, and "?" for optional characters.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">exclude</h4><a id="user-content-exclude" aria-label="Permalink: exclude" href="#exclude"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "exclude" property indicates to the compiler a list of files that should not be included in the compilation. This can include files such as "node_modules" or test files.
Note: tsconfig.json allows comments.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">importHelpers</h3><a id="user-content-importhelpers" aria-label="Permalink: importHelpers" href="#importhelpers"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript uses helper code when generating code for certain advanced or down-leveled JavaScript features. By default, these helpers are duplicated in files using them. The <code>importHelpers</code> option imports these helpers from the <code>tslib</code> module instead, making the JavaScript output more efficient.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Migration to TypeScript Advice</h3><a id="user-content-migration-to-typescript-advice" aria-label="Permalink: Migration to TypeScript Advice" href="#migration-to-typescript-advice"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For large projects, it is recommended to adopt a gradual transition where TypeScript and JavaScript code will initially coexist. Only small projects can be migrated to TypeScript in one go.</p>
<p dir="auto">The first step of this transition is to introduce TypeScript into the build chain process. This can be done by using the "allowJs" compiler option, which permits .ts and .tsx files to coexist with existing JavaScript files. As TypeScript will fall back to a type of "any" for a variable when it cannot infer the type from JavaScript files, it is recommended to disable "noImplicitAny" in your compiler options at the beginning of the migration.</p>
<p dir="auto">The second step is to ensure that your JavaScript tests work alongside TypeScript files so that you can run tests as you convert each module. If you are using Jest, consider using <code>ts-jest</code>, which allows you to test TypeScript projects with Jest.</p>
<p dir="auto">The third step is to include type declarations for third-party libraries in your project. These declarations can be found either bundled or on DefinitelyTyped. You can search for them using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/dt/search" rel="nofollow">https://www.typescriptlang.org/dt/search</a> and install them using:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm install --save-dev @types/package-name"><pre>npm install --save-dev @types/package-name</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">or</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="yarn add --dev @types/package-name."><pre>yarn add --dev @types/package-name.</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The fourth step is to migrate module by module with a bottom-up approach, following your Dependency Graph starting with the leaves. The idea is to start converting Modules that do not depend on other Modules. To visualize the dependency graphs, you can use the "madge" tool.</p>
<p dir="auto">Good candidate modules for these initial conversions are utility functions and code related to external APIs or specifications. It is possible to automatically generate TypeScript type definitions from Swagger contracts, GraphQL or JSON schemas to be included in your project.</p>
<p dir="auto">When there are no specifications or official schemas available, you can generate types from raw data, such as JSON returned by a server. However, it is recommended to generate types from specifications instead of data to avoid missing edge cases.</p>
<p dir="auto">During the migration, refrain from code refactoring and focus only on adding types to your modules.</p>
<p dir="auto">The fifth step is to enable "noImplicitAny," which will enforce that all types are known and defined, providing a better TypeScript experience for your project.</p>
<p dir="auto">During the migration, you can use the <code>@ts-check</code> directive, which enables TypeScript type checking in a JavaScript file. This directive provides a loose version of type checking and can be initially used to identify issues in JavaScript files. When <code>@ts-check</code> is included in a file, TypeScript will try to deduce definitions using JSDoc-style comments. However, consider using JSDoc annotations only at a very early stage of the migration.</p>
<p dir="auto">Consider keeping the default value of <code>noEmitOnError</code> in your tsconfig.json as false. This will allow you to output JavaScript source code even if errors are reported.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Exploring the Type System</h2><a id="user-content-exploring-the-type-system" aria-label="Permalink: Exploring the Type System" href="#exploring-the-type-system"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The TypeScript Language Service</h3><a id="user-content-the-typescript-language-service" aria-label="Permalink: The TypeScript Language Service" href="#the-typescript-language-service"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The TypeScript Language Service, also known as tsserver, offers various features such as error reporting, diagnostics, compile-on-save, renaming, go to definition, completion lists, signature help, and more. It is primarily used by integrated development environments (IDEs) to provide IntelliSense support. It seamlessly integrates with Visual Studio Code and is utilized by tools like Conquer of Completion (Coc).</p>
<p dir="auto">Developers can leverage a dedicated API and create their own custom language service plugins to enhance the TypeScript editing experience. This can be particularly useful for implementing special linting features or enabling auto-completion for a custom templating language.</p>

<p dir="auto">An example of a real-world custom plugin is "typescript-styled-plugin", which provides syntax error reporting and IntelliSense support for CSS properties in styled components.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Structural Typing</h3><a id="user-content-structural-typing" aria-label="Permalink: Structural Typing" href="#structural-typing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript is based on a structural type system. This means that the compatibility and equivalence of types are determined by the type's actual structure or definition, rather than its name or place of declaration, as in nominative type systems like C# or C.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript's structural type system was designed based on how JavaScript's dynamic duck typing system works during runtime.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following example is valid TypeScript code. As you can observe, "X" and "Y" have the same member "a," even though they have different declaration names. The types are determined by their structures, and in this case, since the structures are the same, they are compatible and valid.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = {
    a: string;
};
type Y = {
    a: string;
};
const x: X = { a: 'a' };
const y: Y = x; // Valid"><pre><span>type</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>x</span>: <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>a</span>: <span>'a'</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>y</span>: <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span> <span>// Valid</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">TypeScript Fundamental Comparison Rules</h3><a id="user-content-typescript-fundamental-comparison-rules" aria-label="Permalink: TypeScript Fundamental Comparison Rules" href="#typescript-fundamental-comparison-rules"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The TypeScript comparison process is recursive and executed on types nested at any level.</p>
<p dir="auto">A type "X" is compatible with "Y" if "Y" has at least the same members as "X".</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = {

<p dir="auto">In TypeScript, a type is a set of possible values. This set is also referred to as the domain of the type. Each value of a type can be viewed as an element in a set. A type establishes the constraints that every element in the set must satisfy to be considered a member of that set.
The primary task of TypeScript is to check and verify whether one set is a subset of another.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript supports various types of sets:</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>extends</code> keyword could be considered as a "subset of" in this context. It sets a constraint for a type. The extends used with a generic, take the generic as an infinite set and it will constrain it to a more specific type.
Please note that <code>extends</code> has nothing to do with hierarchy in a OOP sense (there is no this concept in TypeScript).
TypeScript works with sets and does not have a strict hierarchy, infact, as in the example below, two types could overlap without either being a subtype of the other type (TypeScript considers the structure, shape of the objects).</p>

<p dir="auto">A type can be assigned in different ways in TypeScript:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Type Declaration</h4><a id="user-content-type-declaration" aria-label="Permalink: Type Declaration" href="#type-declaration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the following example, we use x: X (": Type") to declare a type for the variable x.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = {
    a: string;
};

// Type declaration
const x: X = {
    a: 'a',
};"><pre><span>type</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

    <span>a</span>: <span>'a'</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If the variable is not in the specified format, TypeScript will report an error. For instance:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = {
    a: string;
};

const x: X = {
    a: 'a',
    b: 'b', // Error: Object literal may only specify known properties
};"><pre><span>type</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

    <span>a</span>: <span>'a'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>b</span>: <span>'b'</span><span>,</span> <span>// Error: Object literal may only specify known properties</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Type Assertion</h4><a id="user-content-type-assertion" aria-label="Permalink: Type Assertion" href="#type-assertion"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It is possible to add an assertion by using the <code>as</code> keyword. This tells the compiler that the developer has more information about a type and silences any errors that may occur.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = {
    a: string;
};
const x = {
    a: 'a',
    b: 'b',
} as X;"><pre><span>type</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>'a'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>b</span>: <span>'b'</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>as</span> <span>X</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In the above example, the object x is asserted to have the type X using the as keyword. This informs the TypeScript compiler that the object conforms to the specified type, even though it has an additional property b not present in the type definition.</p>
<p dir="auto">Type assertions are useful in situations where a more specific type needs to be specified, especially when working with the DOM. For instance:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const myInput = document.getElementById('my_input') as HTMLInputElement;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>myInput</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'my_input'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>HTMLInputElement</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Here, the type assertion as HTMLInputElement is used to tell TypeScript that the result of getElementById should be treated as an HTMLInputElement.
Type assertions can also be used to remap keys, as shown in the example below with template literals:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type J<Type> = {
    [Property in keyof Type as `prefix_${string &amp;
        Property}`]: () => Type[Property];
};
type X = {
    a: string;
    b: number;
};
type Y = J<X>;"><pre><span>type</span> <span>J</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Type</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>Property</span> <span>in</span> <span>keyof</span> <span>Type</span> <span>as</span> `prefix_${<span>string</span> <span>&amp;</span>
        <span>Property</span><span>}</span>`<span>]</span>: <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Type</span><span>[</span><span>Property</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
    <span>b</span>: <span>number</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>J</span><span>&lt;</span><span>X</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In this example, the type <code>J&lt;Type&gt;</code> uses a mapped type with a template literal to remap the keys of Type. It creates new properties with a "prefix_" added to each key, and their corresponding values are functions returning the original property values.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is worth noting that when using a type assertion, TypeScript will not execute excess property checking. Therefore, it is generally preferable to use a Type Declaration when the structure of the object is known in advance.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ambient Declarations</h4><a id="user-content-ambient-declarations" aria-label="Permalink: Ambient Declarations" href="#ambient-declarations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ambient declarations are files that describe types for JavaScript code, they have a file name format as <code>.d.ts.</code>. They are usually imported and used to annotate existing JavaScript libraries or to add types to existing JS files in your project.</p>
<p dir="auto">Many common libraries types can be found at:
<a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/">https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/</a></p>
<p dir="auto">and can be installed using:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm install --save-dev @types/library-name"><pre>npm install --save-dev @types/library-name</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For your defined Ambient Declarations, you can import using the "triple-slash" reference:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="/// <reference path=&quot;./library-types.d.ts&quot; />"><pre><span>/// &lt;reference path="./library-types.d.ts" /&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can use Ambient Declarations even within JavaScript files using <code>// @ts-check</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>declare</code> keyword enables type definitions for existing JavaScript code without importing it, serving as a placeholder for types from another file or globally.</p>

<p dir="auto">TypeScript is based on a structural type system but excess property checking is a property of TypeScript which allows it to check whether an object has the exact properties specified in the type.</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = {

const y = { a: 'a', b: 'b' };

<p dir="auto">Strict object literal checking, sometimes referred to as "freshness", is a feature in TypeScript that helps catch excess or misspelled properties that would otherwise go unnoticed in normal structural type checks.</p>
<p dir="auto">When creating an object literal, the TypeScript compiler considers it "fresh." If the object literal is assigned to a variable or passed as a parameter, TypeScript will throw an error if the object literal specifies properties that do not exist in the target type.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, "freshness" disappears when an object literal is widened or a type assertion is used.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some examples to illustrate:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = { a: string };

y = { a: 'a', bx: 'bx' }; // Freshness check: Invalid assignment

const fn = (x: X) => console.log(x.a);

fn(x);
fn(y); // Widening: No errors, structurally type compatible

fn({ a: 'a', bx: 'b' }); // Freshness check: Invalid argument

let c: X = { a: 'a' };
let d: Y = { a: 'a', b: '' };

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Type Inference</h3><a id="user-content-type-inference" aria-label="Permalink: Type Inference" href="#type-inference"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript can infer types when no annotation is provided during:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Variable initialization.</li>
<li>Member initialization.</li>
<li>Setting defaults for parameters.</li>
<li>Function return type.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x = 'x'; // The type inferred is string"><pre><span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>'x'</span><span>;</span> <span>// The type inferred is string</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The TypeScript compiler analyzes the value or expression and determines its type based on the available information.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">More Advanced Inferences</h3><a id="user-content-more-advanced-inferences" aria-label="Permalink: More Advanced Inferences" href="#more-advanced-inferences"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When multiple expressions are used in type inference, TypeScript looks for the "best common types." For instance:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x = [1, 'x', 1, null]; // The type inferred is: (string | number | null)[]"><pre><span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>'x'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>null</span><span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>// The type inferred is: (string | number | null)[]</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If the compiler cannot find the best common types, it returns a union type. For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x = [new RegExp('x'), new Date()]; // Type inferred is: (RegExp | Date)[]"><pre><span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>new</span> <span>RegExp</span><span>(</span><span>'x'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>// Type inferred is: (RegExp | Date)[]</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript utilizes "contextual typing" based on the variable's location to infer types. In the following example, the compiler knows that <code>e</code> is of type <code>MouseEvent</code> because of the <code>click</code> event type defined in the lib.d.ts file, which contains ambient declarations for various common JavaScript constructs and the DOM:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="window.addEventListener('click', function (e) {}); // The inferred type of e is MouseEvent"><pre><span>window</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'click'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// The inferred type of e is MouseEvent</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Type Widening</h3><a id="user-content-type-widening" aria-label="Permalink: Type Widening" href="#type-widening"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Type widening is the process in which TypeScript assigns a type to a variable initialized when no type annotation was provided. It allows narrow to wider types but not vice versa.
In the following example:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x = 'x'; // TypeScript infers as string, a wide type
let y: 'y' | 'x' = 'y'; // y types is a union of literal types
y = x; // Invalid Type 'string' is not assignable to type '&quot;x&quot; | &quot;y&quot;'."><pre><span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>'x'</span><span>;</span> <span>// TypeScript infers as string, a wide type</span>
<span>let</span> <span>y</span>: <span>'y'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'x'</span> <span>=</span> <span>'y'</span><span>;</span> <span>// y types is a union of literal types</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span> <span>// Invalid Type 'string' is not assignable to type '"x" | "y"'.</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript assigns <code>string</code> to <code>x</code> based on the single value provided during initialization (<code>x</code>), this is an example of widening.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript provides ways to have control of the widening process, for instance using "const".</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Const</h3><a id="user-content-const" aria-label="Permalink: Const" href="#const"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Using the <code>const</code> keyword when declaring a variable results in a narrower type inference in TypeScript.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const x = 'x'; // TypeScript infers the type of x as 'x', a narrower type
let y: 'y' | 'x' = 'y';
y = x; // Valid: The type of x is inferred as 'x'"><pre><span>const</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>'x'</span><span>;</span> <span>// TypeScript infers the type of x as 'x', a narrower type</span>
<span>let</span> <span>y</span>: <span>'y'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'x'</span> <span>=</span> <span>'y'</span><span>;</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span> <span>// Valid: The type of x is inferred as 'x'</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">By using <code>const</code> to declare the variable x, its type is narrowed to the specific literal value 'x'. Since the type of x is narrowed, it can be assigned to the variable y without any error.
The reason the type can be inferred is because <code>const</code> variables cannot be reassigned, so their type can be narrowed down to a specific literal type, in this case, the literal type 'x'.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Const Modifier on Type Parameters</h4><a id="user-content-const-modifier-on-type-parameters" aria-label="Permalink: Const Modifier on Type Parameters" href="#const-modifier-on-type-parameters"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">From version 5.0 of TypeScript, it is possible to specify the <code>const</code> attribute on a generic type parameter. This allows for inferring the most precise type possible. Let's see an example without using <code>const</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="function identity<T>(value: T) {
    // No const here
    return value;
}
const values = identity({ a: 'a', b: 'b' }); // Type infered is: { a: string; b: string; }"><pre><span>function</span> <span>identity</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>value</span>: <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// No const here</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>const</span> <span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>a</span>: <span>'a'</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span>: <span>'b'</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Type infered is: { a: string; b: string; }</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">As you can see, the properties <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are inferred with a type of <code>string</code>   .</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, let's see the difference with the <code>const</code> version:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="function identity<const T>(value: T) {
    // Using const modifier on type parameters
    return value;
}
const values = identity({ a: 'a', b: 'b' }); // Type infered is: { a: &quot;a&quot;; b: &quot;b&quot;; }"><pre><span>function</span> <span>identity</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>value</span>: <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Using const modifier on type parameters</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>const</span> <span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>a</span>: <span>'a'</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span>: <span>'b'</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Type infered is: { a: "a"; b: "b"; }</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now we can see that the properties <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are inferred as <code>const</code>, so <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are treated as string literals rather than just <code>string</code> types.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Const assertion</h4><a id="user-content-const-assertion" aria-label="Permalink: Const assertion" href="#const-assertion"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This feature allows you to declare a variable with a more precise literal type based on its initialization value, signifying to the compiler that the value should be treated as an immutable literal. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p dir="auto">On a single property:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const v = {
    x: 3 as const,
};
v.x = 3;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span>: <span>3</span> <span>as</span> <span>const</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>v</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">On an entire object:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const v = {
    x: 1,
    y: 2,
} as const;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>y</span>: <span>2</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>as</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This can be particularly useful when defining the type for a tuple:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const x = [1, 2, 3]; // number[]
const y = [1, 2, 3] as const; // Tuple of readonly [1, 2, 3]"><pre><span>const</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>// number[]</span>
<span>const</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span> <span>as</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span> <span>// Tuple of readonly [1, 2, 3]</span></pre></div>

<p dir="auto">We can be specific and pass a type, in the following example property <code>x</code> is of type <code>number</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto">Type Narrowing is the process in TypeScript where a general type is narrowed down to a more specific type. This occurs when TypeScript analyzes the code and determines that certain conditions or operations can refine the type information.</p>
<p dir="auto">Narrowing types can occur in different ways, including:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Conditions</h4><a id="user-content-conditions" aria-label="Permalink: Conditions" href="#conditions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By using conditional statements, such as <code>if</code> or <code>switch</code>, TypeScript can narrow down the type based on the outcome of the condition. For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x: number | undefined = 10;

if (x !== undefined) {
    x += 100; // The type is number, which had been narrowed by the condition
}"><pre><span>let</span> <span>x</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Throwing or returning</h4><a id="user-content-throwing-or-returning" aria-label="Permalink: Throwing or returning" href="#throwing-or-returning"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Throwing an error or returning early from a branch can be used to help TypeScript narrow down a type. For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x: number | undefined = 10;

if (x === undefined) {
    throw 'error';
}
x += 100;"><pre><span>let</span> <span>x</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span>
<span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Other ways to narrow down types in TypeScript include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>instanceof</code> operator: Used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class.</li>
<li><code>in</code> operator: Used to check if a property exists in an object.</li>

<p dir="auto">The <code>any</code> data type represents literally "any" value, it is the default value when TypeScript cannot infer the type or is not specified.</p>
<p dir="auto">When using <code>any</code> TypeScript compiler skips the type checking so there is no type safety when <code>any</code> is being used. Generally do not use <code>any</code> to silence the compiler when an error occurs, instead focus on fixing the error as with using <code>any</code>  it is possible to break contracts and we lose the benefits of TypeScript autocomplete.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>any</code> type could be useful during a gradual migration from JavaScript to TypeScript, as it can silence the compiler.</p>
<p dir="auto">For new projects use TypeScript configuration <code>noImplicitAny</code> which enables TypeScript to issue errors where <code>any</code> is used or inferred.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>any</code>type  is usually a source of errors which can mask real problems with your types. Avoid using it as much as possible.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Type Annotations</h2><a id="user-content-type-annotations" aria-label="Permalink: Type Annotations" href="#type-annotations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">On variables declared using <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>, it is possible to optionally add a type:</p>

<p dir="auto">TypeScript does a good job of inferring types, especially when simple one, so these declarations in most cases are not necessary.</p>
<p dir="auto">On functions is possible to add type annotations to parameters:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="function sum(a: number, b: number) {
    return a + b;
}"><pre><span>function</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>a</span>: <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span>: <span>number</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The following is an example using a anonymous functions (so called lambda function):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const sum = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span>: <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span>: <span>number</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">These annotation can be avoided when a default value for a parameter is present:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const sum = (a = 10, b: number) => a + b;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span>: <span>number</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Return type annotations can be added to functions:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const sum = (a = 10, b: number): number => a + b;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span>: <span>number</span><span>)</span>: <span>number</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This is useful especially for  more complex functions as writing expliciting the return type before an implementation can help better think about the function.</p>
<p dir="auto">Generally consider annotating type signatures but not the body local variables and add types always to object literals.</p>

<p dir="auto">A Literal Type is a single element set from a collective type, it defines a very exact value that is a JavaScript primitive.</p>
<p dir="auto">Literal Types in TypeScript are numbers, strings, and booleans.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example of literals:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const a = 'a'; // String literal type
const b = 1; // Numeric literal type
const c = true; // Boolean literal type"><pre><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>'a'</span><span>;</span> <span>// String literal type</span>

<span>const</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span> <span>// Boolean literal type</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">String, Numeric, and Boolean Literal Types are used in the union, type guard, and type aliases.
In the following example you can see a type alias union, <code>O</code> can be the only value specified and not any other string:</p>

<p dir="auto">Literal Inference is a feature in TypeScript that allows the type of a variable or parameter to be inferred based on its value.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the following example we can see that TypeScript considers <code>x</code> a literal type as the value cannot be changed any time later, when instead <code>y</code> is inferred as string as it can be modified any time later.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const x = 'x'; // Literal type of 'x', because this value cannot be changed

<span>let</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>'y'</span><span>;</span> <span>// Type string, as we can change this value</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In the following example we can see that <code>o.x</code> was inferred as a <code>string</code> (and not a literal of <code>a</code>) as TypeScript considers that the value can be changed any time later.</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = 'a' | 'b';

let o = {
    x: 'a', // This is a wider string
};

const fn = (x: X) => `${x}-foo`;

<p dir="auto">As you can see the code throws an error when passing <code>o.x</code> to <code>fn</code> as X is a narrower type.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Constant enums</h3><a id="user-content-constant-enums" aria-label="Permalink: Constant enums" href="#constant-enums"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A constant enum in TypeScript is a special type of Enum where all the values are known at compile time and are inlined wherever the enum is used, resulting in more efficient code.</p>

Const Enums have hardcoded values, erasing the Enum, which can be more efficient in self-contained libraries but is generally not desirable. Also, Const enums cannot have computed members.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Reverse mapping</h3><a id="user-content-reverse-mapping" aria-label="Permalink: Reverse mapping" href="#reverse-mapping"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In TypeScript, reverse mappings in Enums refer to the ability to retrieve the Enum member name from its value. By default, Enum members have forward mappings from name to value, but reverse mappings can be created by explicitly setting values for each member. Reverse mappings are useful when you need to look up an Enum member by its value, or when you need to iterate over all the Enum members. Note that only numeric enums members will generate reverse mappings, while String Enum members do not get a reverse mapping generated at all.</p>

<p dir="auto">In TypeScript, object types describe the shape of an object. They specify the names and types of the object's properties, as well as whether those properties are required or optional.</p>
<p dir="auto">In TypeScript, you can define object types in two primary ways:</p>
<p dir="auto">Interface which defines the shape of an object by specifying the names, types, and optionality of its properties.</p>

    <span>email</span>?: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Type alias, similar to an interface, defines the shape of an object. However, it can also create a new custom type that is based on an existing type or a combination of existing types. This includes defining union types, intersection types, and other complex types.</p>

<p dir="auto">Mapped Types in TypeScript allow you to create new types based on an existing type by transforming each property using a mapping function. By mapping existing types, you can create new types that represent the same information in a different format. To create a mapped type, you access the properties of an existing type using the <code>keyof</code> operator and then alter them to produce a new type.
In the following example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type MyMappedType<T> = {
    [P in keyof T]: T[P][];
};
type MyType = {
    foo: string;
    bar: number;
};
type MyNewType = MyMappedType<MyType>;
const x: MyNewType = {
    foo: ['hello', 'world'],
    bar: [1, 2, 3],
};"><pre><span>type</span> <span>MyMappedType</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

<p dir="auto">The <code>any</code> type is a special type (universal supertype) that can be used to represent any type of value (primitives, objects, arrays, functions, errors, symbols). It is often used in situations where the type of a value is not known at compile time, or when working with values from external APIs or libraries that do not have TypeScript typings.</p>
<p dir="auto">By utilizing <code>any</code> type, you are indicating to the TypeScript compiler that values should be represented without any limitations. In order to maximizing type safety in your code consider the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Limit the usage of <code>any</code> to specific cases where the type is truly unknown.</li>
<li>Do not return <code>any</code> types from a function as you will lose type safety in the code using that function weakening your type safety.</li>

<p dir="auto">TypeScript has several built-in type primitives that can be used to define variables, function parameters, and return types:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>number</code>: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.</li>
<li><code>string</code>: Represents textual data</li>
<li><code>boolean</code>: Represents logical values, which can be either true or false.</li>
<li><code>null</code>: Represents the absence of a value.</li>
<li><code>undefined</code>: Represents a value that has not been assigned or has not been defined.</li>
<li><code>symbol</code>: Represents a unique identifier. Symbols are typically used as keys for object properties.</li>
<li><code>bigint</code>: Represents arbitrary-precision integers.</li>
<li><code>any</code>: Represents a dynamic or unknown type. Variables of type any can hold values of any type, and they bypass type checking.</li>
<li><code>void</code>: Represents the absence of any type. It is commonly used as the return type of functions that do not return a value.</li>
<li><code>never</code>: Represents a type for values that never occur. It is typically used as the return type of functions that throw an error or enter an infinite loop.</li>

<p dir="auto">Merging and extension refer to two different concepts related to working with types and interfaces.</p>
<p dir="auto">Merging allows you to combine multiple declarations of the same name into a single definition, for example, when you define an interface with the same name multiple times:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface X {
    a: string;
}

interface X {
    b: number;
}

const person: X = {
    a: 'a',
    b: 7,
};"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>X</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>

<span>interface</span> <span>X</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>b</span>: <span>number</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Extension refers to the ability to extend or inherit from existing types or interfaces to create new ones. It is a mechanism to add additional properties or methods to an existing type without modifying its original definition. Example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface Animal {
    name: string;
    eat(): void;
}

interface Bird extends Animal {
    sing(): void;
}

const dog: Bird = {
    name: 'Bird 1',
    eat() {
        console.log('Eating');
    },
    sing() {
        console.log('Singing');
    },
};"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>{</span>

<p dir="auto">Declaration merging (augmentation):</p>
<p dir="auto">Interfaces support declaration merging, which means that you can define multiple interfaces with the same name, and TypeScript will merge them into a single interface with the combined properties and methods. On the other hand, types do not support declaration merging. This can be helpful when you want to add extra functionality or customize existing types without modifying the original definitions or patching missing or incorrect types.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface A {
    x: string;
}
interface A {
    y: string;
}
const j: A = {
    x: 'xx',
    y: 'yy',
};"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>interface</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>y</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>const</span> <span>j</span>: <span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span>: <span>'xx'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>y</span>: <span>'yy'</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Extending other types/interfaces:</p>
<p dir="auto">Both types and interfaces can extend other types/interfaces, but the syntax is different. With interfaces, you use the <code>extends</code> keyword to inherit properties and methods from other interfaces. However, an interface cannot extend a complex type like a union type.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface A {
    x: string;
    y: number;
}
interface B extends A {
    z: string;
}
const car: B = {
    x: 'x',
    y: 123,
    z: 'z',
};"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
    <span>y</span>: <span>number</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>interface</span> <span>B</span> <span>extends</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>z</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>const</span> <span>car</span>: <span>B</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>z</span>: <span>'z'</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For types, you use the &amp; operator to combine multiple types into a single type (intersection).</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface A {
    x: string;
    y: number;
}

type B = A &amp; {
    j: string;
};

const c: B = {
    x: 'x',
    y: 123,
    j: 'j',
};"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>

<p dir="auto">Union and Intersection Types:</p>
<p dir="auto">Types are more flexible when it comes to defining Union and Intersection Types. With the <code>type</code> keyword, you can easily create union types using the <code>|</code> operator and intersection types using the <code>&amp;</code> operator. While interfaces can also represent union types indirectly, they don't have built-in support for intersection types.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type Department = 'dep-x' | 'dep-y'; // Union

type Person = {

<p dir="auto">Access Modifiers <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, and <code>public</code> are used to control the visibility and accessibility of class members, such as properties and methods, in TypeScript classes. These modifiers are essential for enforcing encapsulation and establishing boundaries for accessing and modifying the internal state of a class.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>private</code> modifier restricts access to the class member only within the containing class.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>protected</code> modifier allows access to the class member within the containing class and its derived classes.</p>

<p dir="auto">Decorators provide a mechanism to add metadata, modify behavior, validate, or extend the functionality of the target element. They are functions that execute at runtime. Multiple decorators can be applied to a declaration.</p>
<p dir="auto">Decorators are experimental features, and the following examples are only compatible with TypeScript version 5 or above using ES6.</p>
<p dir="auto">For TypeScript versions prior to 5, they should be enabled using the <code>experimentalDecorators</code> property in your <code>tsconfig.json</code> or by using <code>--experimentalDecorators</code> in your command line (but the following example won't work).</p>
<p dir="auto">Some of the common use cases for decorators include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Watching property changes.</li>
<li>Watching method calls.</li>
<li>Adding extra properties or methods.</li>
<li>Runtime validation.</li>
<li>Automatic serialization and deserialization.</li>
<li>Logging.</li>
<li>Authorization and authentication.</li>
<li>Error guarding.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Note: Decorators for version 5 do not allow decorating parameters.</p>
<p dir="auto">Types of decorators:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Class Decorators</h4><a id="user-content-class-decorators" aria-label="Permalink: Class Decorators" href="#class-decorators"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Class Decorators are useful for extending an existing class, such as adding properties or methods, or collecting instances of a class. In the following example, we add a <code>toString</code> method that converts the class into a string representation.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>class</code> keyword in TypeScript, similar to JavaScript, is often referred to as syntactic sugar. It was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to offer a more familiar syntax for creating and working with objects in a class-based manner. However, it's important to note that TypeScript, being a superset of JavaScript, ultimately compiles down to JavaScript, which remains prototype-based at its core.</p>

<p dir="auto">Triple-slash directives are special comments that provide instructions to the compiler about how to process a file. These directives begin with three consecutive slashes (<code>///</code>) and are typically placed at the top of a TypeScript file and have no effects on the runtime behavior.</p>
<p dir="auto">Triple-slash directives are used to reference external dependencies, specify module loading behavior, enable/disable certain compiler features, and more. Few examples:</p>
<p dir="auto">Referencing a declaration file:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="/// <reference path=&quot;path/to/declaration/file.d.ts&quot; />"><pre><span>/// &lt;reference path="path/to/declaration/file.d.ts" /&gt;</span></pre></div>

<p dir="auto">JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript or TypeScript files. It is commonly used in React to define the HTML structure.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript extends the capabilities of JSX by providing type checking and static analysis.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use JSX you need to set the <code>jsx</code> compiler option in your <code>tsconfig.json</code> file. Two common configuration options:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>"preserve": emit .jsx files with the JSX unchanged. This option tells TypeScript to keep the JSX syntax as-is and not transform it during the compilation process. You can use this option if you have a separate tool, like Babel, that handles the transformation.</li>
<li>"react": enables TypeScript's built-in JSX transformation. React.createElement will be used.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">All options are available here:

<p dir="auto">TypeScript does support ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and many subsequent versions. This means you can use ES6 syntax, such as arrow functions, template literals, classes, modules, destructuring, and more.</p>
<p dir="auto">To enable ES6 features in your project, you can specify the <code>target</code> property in the tsconfig.json.</p>
<p dir="auto">A configuration example:</p>

<p dir="auto">A Recursive Type is a type that can refer to itself. This is useful for defining data structures that have a hierarchical or recursive structure (potentially infinite nesting), such as linked lists, trees, and graphs.</p>

<p dir="auto">It is possible to define complex type relationships using logic and recursion in TypeScript.
Let’s break it down in simple terms:</p>
<p dir="auto">Conditional Types: allows you to define types based on boolean conditions:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type CheckNumber<T> = T extends number ? 'Number' : 'Not a number';

<p dir="auto">Recursion: means a type definition that refers to itself within its own definition:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type Json = string | number | boolean | null | Json[] | { [key: string]: Json };

const data: Json = {
    prop1: true,

<p dir="auto">Node.js added support for ECMAScript Modules starting from version 15.3.0, and TypeScript has had ECMAScript Module Support for Node.js since version 4.7. This support can be enabled by using the <code>module</code> property with the value <code>nodenext</code> in the tsconfig.json file. Here's an example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    &quot;module&quot;: &quot;nodenext&quot;,

    <span>"outDir"</span>: <span><span>"</span>./lib<span>"</span></span>,
    <span>"declaration"</span>: <span>true</span>
  }
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Node.js supports two file extensions for modules: <code>.mjs</code> for ES modules and <code>.cjs</code> for CommonJS modules. The equivalent file extensions in TypeScript are <code>.mts</code> for ES modules and <code>.cts</code> for CommonJS modules. When the TypeScript compiler transpiles these files to JavaScript, it will create <code>.mjs</code> and <code>.cjs</code> files.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to use ES modules in your project, you can set the <code>type</code> property to "module" in your package.json file. This instructs Node.js to treat the project as an ES module project.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, TypeScript also supports type declarations in .d.ts files. These declaration files provide type information for libraries or modules written in TypeScript, allowing other developers to utilize them with TypeScript's type checking and auto-completion features.</p>

<p dir="auto">Assertion functions share similarities with type guards. Type guards were initially introduced to perform runtime checks and ensure the type of a value within a specific scope.
Specifically, a type guard is a function that evaluates a type predicate and returns a boolean value indicating whether the predicate is true or false. This differs slightly from assertion functions,where the intention is to throw an error rather than returning false when the predicate is not satisfied.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example of type guard:</p>

<p dir="auto">Variadic Tuple Types are a features introduces in TypeScript version 4.0, let’s start to learn them by revise what is a tuple:</p>
<p dir="auto">A tuple type is an array which has a defined length, and were the type of each element is known:</p>

<p dir="auto">The term "variadic" means indefinite arity (accept a variable number of arguments).</p>
<p dir="auto">A variadic tuple is a tuple type which has all the property as before but the exact shape is not defined yet:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type Bar<T extends unknown[]> = [boolean, ...T, number];

type A = Bar<[boolean]>; // [boolean, boolean, number]

<p dir="auto">With the new variadic tuples we can use:</p>

<p dir="auto">When you access a method like <code>charAt</code> or <code>normalize</code> on a <code>string</code> primitive, JavaScript wraps it in a <code>String</code> object, calls the method, and then throws the object away.</p>

<p dir="auto">Covariance and Contravariance are used to describe how relationships work when dealing with inheritance or assignment of types.</p>
<p dir="auto">Covariance means that a type relationship preserves the direction of inheritance or assignment, so if a type A is a subtype of type B, then an array of type A is also considered a subtype of an array of type B. The important thing to note here is that the subtype relationship is maintained this means that Covariance accept subtype but doesn't accept supertype.</p>
<p dir="auto">Contravariance means that a type relationship reverses the direction of inheritance or assignment, so if a type A is a subtype of type B, then an array of type B is considered a subtype of an array of type A. The subtype relationship is reversed this means that Contravariance accept supertype but doesn't accept subtype.</p>
<p dir="auto">Notes: Bivariance means accept both supertype &amp; subtype.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example: Let's say we have a space for all animals and a separate space just for dogs.</p>
<p dir="auto">In Covariance, you can put all the dogs in the animals space because dogs are a type of animal. But you cannot put all the animals in the dog space because there might be other animals mixed in.</p>
<p dir="auto">In Contravariance, you cannot put all the animals in the dogs space because the animals space might contain other animals as well. However, you can put all the dogs in the animal space because all dogs are also animals.</p>

<p dir="auto">To use type-only imports, you can use the <code>import type</code> keyword.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript permits using both declaration and implementation file extensions (.ts, .mts, .cts, and .tsx) in type-only imports, regardless of <code>allowImportingTsExtensions</code> settings.</p>

<p dir="auto">A <code>using</code> declaration is a block-scoped, immutable binding, similar to <code>const</code>, used for managing disposable resources. When initialized with a value, the <code>Symbol.dispose</code> method of that value is recorded and subsequently executed upon exiting the enclosing block scope.</p>

<p dir="auto">Notes:</p>

But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning.</p><p>Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.</p><p>Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.</p><p>More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.</p><p>Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. "I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying," he recalled. "And an image of a cluster became more clear."</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="A look at the industrial port in the city of Saint John, New Brunswick, with the river and sky both prominent.

But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a "house of cards".</p><p>To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.</p><p>We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was "degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.</p><p>The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.</p><p>Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.</p><p>"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated," said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. "There's all these different levels."</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Grey line "></p></div></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>Lucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy.

All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.</p><p>And the mystery disease got a name: the "New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it "one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen".</p><p>"We all owe you a debt of gratitude," he wrote.</p><p>But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling "flabbergasted" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a "diarrhea of symptoms".</p><p>Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.</p><p>He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email.</p><p>"All available evidence and logic" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote.</p><p>"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not."</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e0f6/live/cf6fbd50-ec79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="grey line"></p></div></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>The early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit.</p><p>Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was "not expected to pose risks" to human health or the environment.)</p><p>According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals.

Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full "boots-on-the-ground" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.</p><p>But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. "Everybody received that email like a cold shower," he said.</p><p>None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.</p><p>But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.</p><p>"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking," Lanteigne said.

The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.</p><p>At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. "He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'."</p><p>Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone.</p><p>"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that."</p><p>Marrero declined to discuss it. "Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment."</p><p>In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. "Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations," wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network. The 105 cluster patients each received their own letter, telling them they could stay at the clinic, with all the resources it had to offer, or strike out alone with Marrero.</p><p>Many were offended on behalf of their neurologist.

FND is a complex condition; previously known as psychosomatic or psychogenic illness, it describes physical symptoms with a psychological root. It presents a challenge to doctors, who have to guide patients through the stigma associated with it to an understanding that they have a real condition that requires complex treatment.</p><p>Partridge's neurologists at the Mind Clinic also reviewed the seizure video she had shown to Marrero. "As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND," Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition.

When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.</p><p>"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet," stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. "He told her that she wasn't alone."</p><p>There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.</p><p>After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.</p><p>The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.</p><p>A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it.</p><p>The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.</p><p>"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems," said her father Andre, angrily.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Global News Jillian Lucas and other patients stand in front of a government building holding signs saying 'We are not a mystery, 'We stand by Doctor Marrero' and other slogans.

He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back.

The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people "co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda".</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Dr Lang stands outside the neurology centre where he works, in Toronto, looking down at the camera in a white lab coat.

Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. "Lives hang in the balance," read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. "It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them," the letter said. "Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history."</p><p>The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.</p><p>Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. "I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty," she said.</p><p>Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.</p><p>"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families," Lang said.</p><p>"I would even go further," Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. "I would say they are being abused."</p><p>Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>This morning I woke up and headed to my bomb shelter to grab the bike pump to inflate the tyres on my children’s bikes. The handle got slightly tangled up in the fibre optic cables so I lifted up the cables to free the pump.</p><p>Like cookie crumbs the fibre cable’s sleeve jackets crumbled in my hands.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/fibre_jacket_crumbling.jpg" width="" height="" alt="fibre no more"></p><hr><p>Before I could even utter “Oh fuck no”, another section of the cable exploded outwards with thin metal wires jutting out from what seems to be like strands of white plastic threads, which I assume is the Kevlar sheath. I think I must have stood in my pseudo server room in shock for a whole minute, unable to move or process what had happened. A main component of why I was in sheer horror was the fact that I had stupidly buried all of these cables under my cement flooring in PVC trunking from my shelter to all of the rooms in the flat. If this cable fails, the connection from the server room to a specific room would be permanently severed. The room for this particular cable turned out to be my home office where my homelab MS-A2 resided.</p><p>I had purchased these cables from <a href="https://www.fs.com/sg/products/70220.html">FS.com</a> roughly 3.5 years ago in 2022. Because I was burying the cables underground permanently, I opted to get the <strong>MiLiTaRy GrAdE</strong> armoured fibre cables for this purpose.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/original_order.png" width="" height="" alt="MILITARY GRADE"></p><hr><p>The cables had been kept spooled up with a radius of around 5cm for 3 whole years, lightly tied together with hook and loop cable fasteners and hung on laundry hooks in the shelter all this time.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/organisation.jpg" width="" height="" alt="How cables were stored"></p><hr><p>The destroyed cable is the only one that I had unravelled recently to patch into my UDM to enable SFP+ connection to my office space. As it turns out, armoured cables in this specific instance aren’t really meant for movement, it’s likely more of a bury and forget purpose. In hindsight I should’ve connected all of the cables to a fibre patch panel on the wall so that they would never move, then connect the patch panel to my UDM with easily replaceable LSZH cables.</p><p>But it’s too late now, all I can do is to salvage the situation. I headed out and purchased 3M self-bonding rubber electrical tape 23, and Temflex 160 vinyl electrical tape. The idea I had was to use the compression properties of the stretched rubber tape to hold the corrugated metal sheath and wire mesh in place, before wrapping a second vinyl protection layer outside with the 160.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/wrap.jpg" width="" height="" alt="wrapping away"></p><hr><p>However, the wrapping process itself requires me to slowly shift the cable around to hook onto higher ground to prevent kinks. The action itself triggered more jacket failures. Some of the failures actually forced the cable in a sharp right angle, which I am almost certain has caused kinks and cracks in the inner fibre strand. RIP.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/shit.jpg" width="" height="" alt="shit">
<img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/shit_shit.jpg" width="" height="" alt="shit shit">
<img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/shit_shit_shit.jpg" width="" height="" alt="shit shit shit"></p><hr><p>At this point, I’m looking at rebuilding the entire sleeve jacket of anything that’s exposed and movable with electrical tape. What I had previously thought was a good idea to keep about 5-10m of slack to allow me to easily move my server rack around is now causing me more problems as good electrical tape ain’t cheap. I have to essentially repair around 10 metres of jacket without accidentally destroying parts inside trunking that I am unable to reach. This is assuming that the 4 other untouched cables wouldn’t spontaneously crumble as well. Based on how they felt in my hand, I think it is an inevitable outcome.</p><p>I’m pretty certain that datacentre technicians reading this by chance would mock my idiotic setup and I would be inclined to join in. This is not a good day.</p><p>On the dim side of things, at least it seems like fibre optic cables are pretty hardy. My MS-A2 SFP+ connection is still working and <code>speedtest-cli</code> is reporting around 4000/3000 Mbps up/down speeds to my ISP (10G fibre internet plan). UDM is seeing 6000/7000, so the fibre cable is definitely compromised. :(</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

The rendering present in the game was phenomenal for its time and as such received multiple graphics awards.&nbsp; To understand the what the developers achieve and could have been achieved we have to first understand the PC computing landscape 20 years ago**.</span></p><h2><span>2001&nbsp;</span></h2><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLxdhyphenhyphenUnEoFbXt3FVGdye-K6JS_SseYnF5RW3M8kOyzRa7zXXMJOKte_n5UoMWZBwuu32MHOoMCNo_BOtb9tMEvKquZP3JyHo-ftvL-n56nlaDLFIHcqVC2aSddJF5Yk_4abr5a8kZpise/"><span><img alt="" data-original-height="580" data-original-width="1030" height="413" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLxdhyphenhyphenUnEoFbXt3FVGdye-K6JS_SseYnF5RW3M8kOyzRa7zXXMJOKte_n5UoMWZBwuu32MHOoMCNo_BOtb9tMEvKquZP3JyHo-ftvL-n56nlaDLFIHcqVC2aSddJF5Yk_4abr5a8kZpise/w733-h413/slide_show.gif" width="733"></span></a></p></div><p><span>Max Payne was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/12140/Max_Payne/">released targeting</a> directx 8.0 with specs of 450 Mhz cpu (singular) and 16 Mb graphics card. Two put this in perspective that is roughly three orders of magnitude less GPU memory than a modern RTX 2080. The DirectX 8.0 graphics API at least has pixel and vertex shaders but the spec had extreme limitations on caps like <a href="https://hardwaresecrets.com/directx-versions/">number of instructions</a>.&nbsp; The 450 Mhz cpu is more than two orders of magnitude slower than a modern PC cpu today.</span></p><p><span>So with this perspective in mind we can probably conclude** that the rendering will be limited to:</span></p><blockquote><ul><li><span>Forward only rendering (no render-to-texture)&nbsp;</span></li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><span>No dynamic shadows&nbsp;</span></li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><span>Very low resolution textures&nbsp;</span></li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><span>Hundreds of polys on screen</span></li></ul></blockquote><p><span>So with these severe limitations how was such realism and fidelity possible? The answer is an amazing technical synergy of rendering smoke and mirrors.&nbsp; <b>Most of these techniques could be summarized as tricking the human visual perception into thinking complex rendering computations are being done live in realtime when they are actually have been precalculated. </b>The next sections will examine in detail each technique and how they contribute to the total graphical experience.</span></p><h2><span>Particle Effects</span></h2><p><span>The particle effects of this game are its best graphical feature.

Soft clipping is normally implemented by reading the depth buffer which is not possible here. It might be possible to achieve soft clipping by CPU side manipulation of the particle quads that clip the ground plane. It might also be possible to do a ground plane representation in the pixel/vertex shader such that near plane quads fade out completely before touching the ground surface.</span></li><li><span>The particles do not interact with the environment&nbsp;at all. This is pretty common for particle systems in general. However there are situations where a few of these particles could have benefitted&nbsp;from a simple path trace of the static geometry. Given that the game is all about tracing bullets through the air this was definitely possible. There would be a limit on how many particles could do this but that could depend the dynamic&nbsp;scenario.</span></li><li><span>Finally the timing for decals to appear and the manner in which they appear is slightly offset from what is correct. This could be due to frame latencies in the engine itself but considering the excessive usage of slowmo in the title some timing cleanup would be beneficial.</span></li></ul><h2><span>Lighting</span></h2><p><span><span>Max Payne used prebaked lightmaps for static geometry.&nbsp; This means static geometry has an entirely separate texture layer that corresponds to the sum incoming irradiance.&nbsp; The reason why this is separate and not simply baked into the texture of static objects is because the high resolution albedo textures are reused everywhere in a scene. Each usage may have a different lighting condition which means they need to correspond to different parts of a texture.&nbsp; Since the light map uniquely covers the entire visible scene the texel density is quite low.&nbsp; It should also be noted that for Max Payne this appears to only be a light map and apparently not a Radiosity map with indirect reflections**.</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHSw8VWrsStEo8axdDg1EMsprvytvmHBHhQ8zy_f51FRrCxqr9jAhg8X-9keYNjsfI_As5UIZ66gREGMVMUOc24eV9Nd5zCDCNdi_93yWnsi3ItYf3DxjsGeEVB04U0mIHp4c5K6oLIASM/"><span><img alt="" data-original-height="642" data-original-width="922" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHSw8VWrsStEo8axdDg1EMsprvytvmHBHhQ8zy_f51FRrCxqr9jAhg8X-9keYNjsfI_As5UIZ66gREGMVMUOc24eV9Nd5zCDCNdi_93yWnsi3ItYf3DxjsGeEVB04U0mIHp4c5K6oLIASM/s16000/20210704173626_1.jpg"></span></a></td></tr><tr><td><span>Light mapping shadow from shower wall.

Simple planar reflections in these cases would have made for a more dynamic rendering impression.</span></p><h2><span>Scenes</span></h2><p><span>In this final section we shall look at a screenshots from a few key scenes to get a sense of how all these techniques come together to produce a single compelling image.</span></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxvuzmP_EtXEzoZ_fLi7vhh9s75taoxe2icv5O4WngarvXcy8QNFGRp7U1MxUVYl4iuIY1Y2i7ADcCCHRU5AdOoMkyqn2SP-xHAGzPTkLxOSJXbRMN8PPf1vBOAeNJpy61NxgDszW_A3ZH/"><span><img data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxvuzmP_EtXEzoZ_fLi7vhh9s75taoxe2icv5O4WngarvXcy8QNFGRp7U1MxUVYl4iuIY1Y2i7ADcCCHRU5AdOoMkyqn2SP-xHAGzPTkLxOSJXbRMN8PPf1vBOAeNJpy61NxgDszW_A3ZH/s16000/20210711161032_2.jpg"></span></a></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJ1IO79NnFIrAwpd2SzRzNAOu8J7Z8vPNZduWfOzzgv5k2WFG9BACXsKuSOCxi3_7aq9teY-wjrWEMw1FDuT8rFKtmDii-BVGMjo4ovH28BPC3Z08Wnu1uDEH629wS8Nonw5Dw-fFUjjBG/"><span><img alt="" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJ1IO79NnFIrAwpd2SzRzNAOu8J7Z8vPNZduWfOzzgv5k2WFG9BACXsKuSOCxi3_7aq9teY-wjrWEMw1FDuT8rFKtmDii-BVGMjo4ovH28BPC3Z08Wnu1uDEH629wS8Nonw5Dw-fFUjjBG/s16000/20210711160913_1.jpg"></span></a></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOM-tdeoidPXRn50abrF5gTCCIipDT4GM7CPYtMzDwKUy3RRxucYoHCHwvDGnMNR0EhkkzG1Q-Q2bqM3el1epP7AGoJShbaa7MFvWDt4-XVk-59LPylqK0LdOxMAZFVOkQl3BqviBEX_uV/"><span><img alt="" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOM-tdeoidPXRn50abrF5gTCCIipDT4GM7CPYtMzDwKUy3RRxucYoHCHwvDGnMNR0EhkkzG1Q-Q2bqM3el1epP7AGoJShbaa7MFvWDt4-XVk-59LPylqK0LdOxMAZFVOkQl3BqviBEX_uV/s16000/20210704220813_1.jpg"></span></a></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8UnFOrY_uqEtt3QAw7a1k4qXQqdfYj-sZwyQh6-6WxF9FttJrhzjYlT4zUSLN4hA_bRzpLioq9yhajyfYqggIRN3Yn4Vc-gE8q8JZLV_tbmFVSc-rXpraMdxW23vnhlIZ-iYsg76QoB7-/"><span><img alt="" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8UnFOrY_uqEtt3QAw7a1k4qXQqdfYj-sZwyQh6-6WxF9FttJrhzjYlT4zUSLN4hA_bRzpLioq9yhajyfYqggIRN3Yn4Vc-gE8q8JZLV_tbmFVSc-rXpraMdxW23vnhlIZ-iYsg76QoB7-/s16000/20210711160512_1.jpg"></span></a></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrrki6XEMRL0AL3o6tgRPFLopjnENqlUFGSAUZGMIOFGYFabsPEyj8NQDSUcEwwWvS657MKt0ubSBjPmtb29qsQN7Hk_I_MOzkGpv76xjq_LgR6UrvJK98ljH1oDxS6EYQupw8Rs0FtRXb/"><span><img alt="" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrrki6XEMRL0AL3o6tgRPFLopjnENqlUFGSAUZGMIOFGYFabsPEyj8NQDSUcEwwWvS657MKt0ubSBjPmtb29qsQN7Hk_I_MOzkGpv76xjq_LgR6UrvJK98ljH1oDxS6EYQupw8Rs0FtRXb/s16000/20210718232917_1.jpg"></span></a></p><h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p><span>With a larger investment and perhaps different technical choices&nbsp;Max Payne could possibly have looked even better than it did in 2001. However the graphical result produced at that time was still far and away better than other titles in this period. The rendering quality of this game was not seen in other titles for several years. This game stands as a remarkable technical accomplishment and a significant&nbsp;entry in the history of progression in realtime rendering.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>* All screenshots of all games were taken by the author and are presented here for the intent purpose of review and criticism (technical and aesthetic)</span></p><p><span>** All 'claims' here are in the form of opinions made based on the author's industry experience and not on detailed inspection of source code or on secret non-public knowledge</span></p><p><span>Highlighted references:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Payne_(video_game)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Payne_(video_game)</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/12140/Max_Payne/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/12140/Max_Payne/</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/rtx-2080/">https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/rtx-2080/</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://hardwaresecrets.com/directx-versions/">https://hardwaresecrets.com/directx-versions/</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf">https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/$detail">https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/$detail</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Cubemaps">https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Cubemaps</a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambertian_reflectance">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambertian_reflectance</a></span></p></div>
