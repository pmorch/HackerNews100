<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">In September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission joined regulators in four states to sue four men behind a notorious telemarketing company called Outreach Calling. The FTC alleged that the company, which it described as a “sprawling fundraising operation,” had raised millions on the promise of helping the needy — cancer patients, veterans, firefighters — but instead used the money to line its pockets.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">The case was meant to put fundraisers on notice. The FTC would not only go after charities that improperly spent donor dollars, but it would “aggressively pursue their fundraisers who participate in the deception,” a news release said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">The executives and corporate entities behind the operation were fined more than $58 million. They were also banned from all charitable fundraising for life. But regulators kept one door open in most of the settlements: the ability to continue fundraising for political purposes.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">For Thomas Berkenbush, who was a co-manager at Outreach, that provision would prove to be a windfall.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">Before the deal with the FTC was even finalized, Berkenbush filed paperwork to establish a new company, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=Office+Edge&amp;toggle=expenditures">Office Edge LLC</a>. Since then, Office Edge has been paid about $866,000 for fundraising from organizations that similarly claim to be working on behalf of cancer patients, veterans and firefighters. The difference? These groups are not charities, they’re political nonprofits that claim to use donations to influence elections and support broad political causes.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">The groups that are hiring Berkenbush are <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/">known as 527s</a>, after a section of the tax code. They include federal political action committees — organizations that raise money to elect or defeat candidates and are regulated by the Federal Election Commission — but also a lesser-known group of nonprofits. These 527 groups limit their direct support to political candidates, removing them from the jurisdiction of the FEC or similar state agencies and leaving their regulation to the IRS. They do not have restrictions on how much donors can contribute, but the donations are not tax deductible.</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">A ProPublica investigation has connected Berkenbush to a network of at least 10 of these 527 groups that have raised more than $33 million on the promise of supporting admirable causes, but that have spent little on activities that could be construed as having a political purpose. Most of the money goes to fundraisers who have only been paid by 527s in the group ProPublica identified.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Experts say that it’s hard for the public to follow the business practices of 527 groups because of how difficult it is to access the records that the IRS publishes about their activity. Data about 527 organizations is published on an <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/political-organizations/political-organization-filing-and-disclosure">IRS website</a> in a hard-to-use data file with a limited search interface. On top of that, experts said that there is lax oversight by the federal agencies in charge of regulating the groups.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">“There is no enforcement whatsoever,” said William Josephson, the former head of the charities bureau within New York’s attorney general’s office. “It’s just not a big enough issue for the IRS.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">None of the organizations responded to ProPublica’s requests for comment. But during the process of our reporting, the eight groups that have websites added prominent “Transparency Statements” with essentially identical language.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">“We advocate for the needs of veterans, by informing voters of these needs and asking them to take action. This is our only purpose,” the <a href="https://www.disabledvetspac.org/transparency-statement.html">statement</a> for the National Coalition for Disabled Veterans reads. It also says, “When you make a contribution, we want you to know that a minimum of 90 cents of every dollar will be dedicated to covering our fundraising costs and outreach efforts.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">The IRS did not respond to questions from ProPublica about our findings in any detail. The FTC declined to comment on why some of the settlement agreements in its case against Outreach Calling permitted political fundraising. The New York attorney general’s office, whose lawyers played a significant role in the case, told ProPublica that it can’t prohibit political fundraising because of First Amendment protections. But it maintained that the settlement agreements forbid the defendants from engaging in any fraudulent conduct while fundraising, regardless of the organization’s tax status or stated purpose.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">Under the terms of the settlements, the defendants — who did not admit or deny any of the allegations in the FTC complaint — were required to submit yearly compliance reports to New York, disclosing all fundraising activity for five years after the agreement was reached. The office confirmed that some of the defendants have reported business activity with 527 groups but did not say whether this prompted any investigations. Berkenbush did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">Eggers has given at least $1,500 to the nonprofit in the past three years.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">The American Breast Cancer Coalition, for example, has taken in nearly $9 million from donors since 2019 and has spent less than half of 1% of that on “voter advocacy and outreach.” The rest of the money — millions of dollars — goes to companies with names like <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=Action+Committee+Marketing+LLC&amp;toggle=expenditures">Action Committee Marketing</a>, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=Capital+Vendor+Management+Inc&amp;toggle=expenditures">Capital Vendor Management</a> and Berkenbush’s Office Edge.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">The network has paid millions to a handful of other vendors, including one of Berkenbush’s former colleagues at Outreach Calling, whose company brought in more than $3.4 million in expenditures.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">At least half of the organizations ProPublica identified worked with the same Morristown, Tennessee-based accounting firm on their IRS filings, Purkey, Carter, Compton, Swann &amp; Carter. Bohms also uses the firm for his own nonprofit, the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/465432355">Volunteer Firefighter Alliance</a>, telling ProPublica that the firm maintained high standards of integrity. The firm did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0">Fire departments across the country warned people against donating to Bohms’ charity, and both he and the charity were written about in a 2020 <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/12/09/meet-the-man-at-the-center-of-a-shadowy-multimillion-dollar-scam-pac-network/">Salon story</a> that connected Bohms to a network of “scam PACs.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">“VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER ALLIANCE is a FRAUD!” exclaimed one 2021 post on Facebook from the Alpha Fire Company in Centre County, Pennsylvania. “Do not give money to this organization!

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">Records show that one of the charity’s main fundraisers was Outreach Calling, the company shut down by the FTC. The Volunteer Firefighters Alliance paid $4.8 million to the company for fundraising in total. Bohms defended Outreach’s work, telling ProPublica that he “found Outreach Calling to be very professional and had never experienced any problems with them.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">Bohms’ family members also appear to help run the nonprofits that pay his companies. His sister, Julie Forsythe, is listed as the treasurer of the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/orgs/843763242/">National Cancer Alliance</a>, which “works to establish the end of childhood cancer by making it a state and national priority.” Another organization, the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/orgs/853307234">National Coalition for Disabled Veterans PAC</a>, reports its treasurer as Bohms’ aunt, Judith Gragert. In the last five years, these two organizations have raised over $7 million from more than 700 donors around the country.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">Like all of these groups, neither used much of the money they raised in support of their stated efforts. Effectively all of the expenditures that both groups reported were for either fundraising or other administrative costs. Together, the organizations paid more than $300,000 to Campaign Marketing Inc., the company owned by Bohms.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">Gragert and Forsythe did not respond to requests for comment. Bohms told ProPublica that he works with 527 groups “strictly in the capacity of a vendor,” and that the payments made to his companies were for legitimate services. He denied any involvement in decision-making at the groups that listed his aunt and sister as treasurer.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">“It is important to understand that the payments made to fundraisers encompass more than just fundraising activities,” Bohms wrote in an emailed <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24762422-alan-bohms-response">response</a>. “These funds support a broad range of outreach efforts, including phone calls and direct mail campaigns that are designed to inform the public about the PAC’s goals and initiatives.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">At least one of the groups ProPublica identified has been sued over its fundraising practices. A pair of call recipients filed a lawsuit seeking class-action status in 2022 against the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/orgs/854325630">National Police &amp; Sheriffs Coalition PAC</a>. Lawyers for the plaintiffs alleged that the group used prerecorded voice calls to contact potential donors without their consent, in violation of FCC rules that are meant to protect consumers from telemarketers.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">“Many of these PACs are illegitimate,” said Eric Weitz, whose law firm is on the team representing plaintiffs. “They prey on people’s political leanings.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">One of the defendants named in the lawsuit was Frank Pulciani, the organization’s treasurer. Pulciani maintained that prerecorded messages were not improperly used in calls to donors, and that the fundraising company the group hired was responsible for ensuring that calls complied with the law. Pulciani settled with the plaintiffs for undisclosed terms, and the organization was dissolved in February of last year.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">Pulciani is also closely connected to Bohms. The two men, who both produce and act in low-budget films, recently worked on a project called “Murder by Association.” In its trailer, posted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uhl2kxE_BU">YouTube</a>, Bohms and Pulciani can be seen decked out in suits and dark sunglasses.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">Pulciani did not respond to requests for comment. Robert Bernhoft, whose firm represented Pulciani in the lawsuit, declined to comment.</p>

<h3>Used and Abused</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">For Eggers, the donor who gave to the American Breast Cancer Coalition, the revelation that some of the organizations he’s been supporting are using almost none of what they raise for their stated purpose was discouraging.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">“I feel like I’m being used and they’re being abused,” he said, referring to those he aimed to help with his donations.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">On the mantle above Eggers’ fireplace rests a selection of plaques, framed photographs and certificates that showcase his commitment to giving. One award from 2012, titled “Lending a Helping Hand,” recognizes his 31 years of volunteering for a local organization providing services to the homeless. Another, from a regional branch of the American Red Cross, celebrates his donations to a blood platelet program.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">He showed ProPublica a letter he received from the American Breast Cancer Coalition this past April.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">“Through your much-needed support, we hope to educate the public about our nation’s important Breast Cancer health bills,” reads the letter, thanking him for his donation. It noted that the group was not a charity —&nbsp;key to the FTC order against former Outreach Calling employees. And further down, it stated, “A large portion of proceeds from this campaign are used to defray the costs of fundraising.”</p>

<p>Huber’s Butchery, in Singapore’s upscale Dempsey Hill neighborhood, has long drawn shoppers looking for more than just cold cuts. Starting last month, the deli’s freezer section has stocked shredded chicken grown from cells in a lab, the first time anywhere in the world that cultivated meat can be bought in a store, its manufacturer said.</p>



<p>Cultivated meat has been available at a handful of restaurants in Singapore and the U.S. for a couple of years. But the <a href="https://www.goodmeat.co/all-news/good-meat-begins-the-worlds-first-retail-sales-of-cultivated-chicken">launch</a> of Good Meat 3 — from California-based food technology firm Eat Just&nbsp; — at Huber’s is a high point for the industry that has been in the doldrums lately. Investor interest is flagging, and cultivated meat has been banned in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/italys-parliament-approves-ban-lab-grown-food-amid-tensions-2023-11-16/">Italy</a>, and in the U.S. states of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/13/lab-grown-meat-ban-alabama/73678952007/">Alabama</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/05/05/florida-lab-grown-meat-ban/73569976007/">Florida</a>.</p>



<p>The retail launch “is more than a milestone for the company, it is also a milestone for the cultivated meat industry,” Josh Tetrick, Eat Just’s co-founder and chief executive, told <em>Rest of World</em>. The formulation of its new product uses just 3% cultivated chicken in order to sell at a lower price point so more people can try it, he said. “Singapore’s population has always demonstrated a remarkable openness to new technologies in food and elsewhere, making it the perfect marketplace for novel foods like cultivated meats.”</p>



<p>Unlike plant-based meats that have become commonplace with brands such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, cultivated meat has struggled to get off the ground after an initial wave of enthusiasm.</p>



<p>The tissue-engineering techniques behind cultivated meat have long been used in making vaccines and drugs: Animal fat and tissue are grown in a lab from cells, then processed into a variety of proteins. The obvious advantages are that it needs less land and water to produce, and can lower greenhouse gas emissions. But cultivated meat is expensive to produce and hard to scale, and has struggled to hold investor interest.</p>



<p>The more than <a href="https://gfi.org/resource/cultivated-meat-and-seafood-state-of-the-industry-report/">$3 billion</a> put into cultivated meat worldwide over the last decade is a fraction of the investments in other technologies, such as renewable energy, which are also aimed at reducing emissions.<strong> </strong>“The biggest obstacle to cultivated meat reaching the masses … is the broad underinvestment in R&amp;D and manufacturing infrastructure, especially from governments,” Mirte Gosker, managing director of the nonprofit Good Food Institute Asia Pacific, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Singapore’s foray into alternative proteins began in earnest in March 2019, with its “<a href="https://www.ourfoodfuture.gov.sg/30by30/">30 by 30” vision</a> to sustainably produce 30% of its nutritional needs locally by 2030 — up from 10%. Alternative protein is a key part of this plan. But its strategy “goes beyond simply meeting its own domestic needs,” said Gosker.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The biggest obstacle to cultivated meat reaching the masses … is the broad underinvestment in R&amp;D and manufacturing infrastructure.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“As a small country with limited natural resources, Singapore cannot single-handedly feed the world,” she said. “But it can serve as the place where companies from all around the world come to work with top-tier research agencies and food-tech partners to refine their formulations, eliminate inefficiencies in their manufacturing process, and explore new techniques and ingredients that could help them drive down costs.”</p>



<p>Singapore was the first country to approve cultivated meat, with the nod for Eat Just’s chicken nuggets in December 2020. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) recently <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/s-pore-approves-lab-grown-quail-for-consumption-here">greenlit</a> Australia-based Vow’s <a href="https://www.forgedbyvow.com/">cultivated quail</a> for restaurants — the second company to receive a local license, and just the fourth globally. Later this year, SFA is expected to approve cultivated chicken and pork from French firm Vital Meat and Dutch company Meatable, respectively.</p>



<p>There are about a dozen local alternative-protein startups in the country, and some 15 from Europe, the U.S., South Korea, Israel, and Hong Kong. While investments in other countries may be larger, “one of Singapore’s greatest strengths is the tight-knit innovation community which facilitates seamless collaboration between startups, researchers, and government agencies,” Gosker said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government has so far committed some $230 million towards alternative proteins — from grants to training researchers to building capabilities in bioprocessing and other complementary technologies. Singapore “invested very heavily in getting technological expertise into its government regulatory departments,” Simon Eassom, chief executive of Food Frontier, an Australia-based think tank, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “That means it’s able to fast-track a lot of these applications safely.” Applications only take half, or a third, of the time to process, compared to Australia or the U.S., he said.</p>



<p>Singapore is the “perfect spot” for testing, George Peppou, co-founder and chief executive of Vow,<strong> </strong>told <em>Rest of World</em>. The speed of approvals is the “driving reason” why Vow launched its cultivated quail in Singapore, he said. “We have an application with the FDA, but we’re not intending to launch in the U.S. anytime soon … It’s a very expensive market to launch in, and now it’s so politically sensitive, it wouldn’t be worth the investment.”</p>

<p>The United States and Israel approved the sale of cultivated chicken and beef in June 2023 and January 2024, respectively. Australia and New Zealand are <a href="https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/food-standards-code/applications/A1269-Cultured-Quail-as-a-Novel-Food">jointly assessing</a> Vow’s cultivated quail for approval. China added cultivated meat to its five-year plan for food in 2022, while South Korea set up a <a href="https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/south-korea-cultivated-meat-regulatory-approval-ministry/">regulatory framework</a> for cultivated meat this year. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2022/09/30/vertical-farms-and-lab-grown-beef-gulf-investors-develop-a-taste-for-future-foods/?sh=5dbd58fe6334">investing heavily</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Singapore’s Islamic Religious Council <a href="https://www.muis.gov.sg/Media/Media-Releases/2024/2/3-Feb-24-Fatwa-on-Cultivated-Meat">declared</a> cultivated meat halal earlier this year, expanding the potential consumer base in the multiethnic country. In April, state-backed sustainable food firm Nurasa opened a <a href="https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/about-edb/media-releases-publications/nurasa-unveils-asia-premier-food-tech-nnovation-centre-to-enable-sustainable-nutrition-solutions.html">food innovation center</a> that offers food-tech startups facilities such as 100-liter bioreactors to help produce at scale. Some of Eat Just’s Good Meat 3 was produced there.</p>



<p>“Shared developmental resources like this can help solve specific problems in the value chain and bottlenecks that many companies share,” Mihir Pershad, who moved from the U.S. state of Maryland to Singapore, told <em>Rest of World. </em>Pershad’s <a href="https://umamibioworks.com/technology/">Umami Bioworks</a>, which makes cultivated seafood, has secured R&amp;D grants and meetings with potential overseas customers through the Singapore government, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Worldwide, there are nearly 200 cultivated meat companies. Although prices in the nascent industry have declined since the first lab-grown beef burger debuted in 2013 at a staggering $330,000, they still need to fall to under $10 per kilo — roughly a tenth of current costs — to be competitive in the mass market, <a href="https://gfi-apac.org/2023-apac-state-of-the-industry-report/">estimates</a> the Good Food Institute.</p>



<p>Cultivated meat may reach <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/agriculture/our-insights/cultivated-meat-out-of-the-lab-into-the-frying-pan">cost parity</a> with conventional meat by 2030, with the market worth about $25 billion by then, according to McKinsey &amp; Company. But investor interest has flagged: The industry raised just $226 million last year, a steep fall from $922 million in 2022, according to the Good Food Institute. Several Silicon Valley startups have <a href="https://www.foodprocessing.com/ingredients/alternative-protein/news/33002716/cultivated-meat-startup-new-age-eats-shuts-down">collapsed</a> or <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/upside-foods-glenview-illinois-factory-lab-grown-meat/">shelved expansion plans</a>. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eat-just-financial-problems/">Eat Just</a> is also under pressure in the U.S.</p>



<div><p>Startups are also still finding investors: Cellivate Technologies, a Singapore company focused on cell-based solutions for the cultivated meat industry, recently beat out nearly two dozen startups in Southeast Asia to win a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/brandstudio/cellivate-technologies-raises-eyebrows-it-secures-hefty-funding-final-round-big-spark-4214561">business reality TV show</a>, with commitments of about $3 million from venture capital firms.</p><p>“There is much more work to be done to prove that cultivated meat can be made at large scale,” said Eat Just’s Tetrick. “[But] this year, we will sell more servings of cultivated chicken than have been sold in any year prior.” As for its newest product, Huber’s Butchery is “pretty much selling most of what is supplied to us,” Andre Huber, the executive director, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “Response has been great.”</p></div>

<p>
  Like many Unix users,
  I long ago created a <tt>~/bin/</tt> directory in my home directory
  and added it to my <tt>PATH</tt>
  so that I could supplement
  the wonderfully rich set of basic Unix commands
  with some conveniences and shell scripts of my own devising.
</p>
<p>
  The problem, of course, was the chance of collision.
  Because my shell script names
  tended to be short and pithy collections of lowercase characters,
  just like the default system commands,
  there was no telling when Linux would add a new command
  that would happen to have the same name as one of mine.
  This was actually not very likely on,
  say, a System&nbsp;V Revision&nbsp;3 workstation in the 1980s,
  but the trouble became quite a bit more acute
  when I moved into the world of Debian.
  Red Hat never really worried me,
  because they packaged (comparatively) so little software.
  But Debian today supports a huge number of commands;
  my modest Ubuntu laptop shows several thousand available:
</p>
<div><pre><span>$</span> <span>apt</span><span>-</span><span>file</span> <span>search</span> <span>-</span><span>x</span> <span>'</span><span>^/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>[</span><span>^/</span><span>]</span><span>*</span><span>$'</span> <span>|</span> <span>wc</span> <span>-</span><span>l</span>
<span>21733</span></pre></div>

<p>
  The solution was obviously to adjust my command names
  in such a way that they were still easy to type,
  but would never be chosen as system command names.
  For me, “easy to type” means not having to use the shift key,
  and very few characters turned out to be available,
  unshifted, on a modern keyboard.
  The lower-case letters
  are the very characters used in system commands;
  brackets, backslashes, the colon, the back-tick, and the single-tick
  all had a special meaning to the shell;
  and the slash and dot characters both mean something special
  in a filename.
  (The slash divides directory names from filenames,
  and thus cannot appear in a filename itself,
  while the dot means “hide this file from normal browsing”
  if it leads the name,
  and separates a file from its extension in many other cases.)
</p>
<p>
  There was but one character left: the simple, modest comma.
</p>
<p>
  A quick experiment revealed in a flash
  that the comma was <i>exactly</i> the character
  that I had been looking for!
  Every tool and shell that lay in arm's reach
  treated the comma as a perfectly normal
  and unobjectionable character in a filename.
  By simply prefixing each of my custom commands
  with a comma,
  they became completely distinct from system commands
  and thus free from any chance of a collision.
</p>
<p>
  And, best of all,
  thanks to the magic of tab-completion,
  it became very easy to browse my entire collection of commands.
  When trying to remember which of my commands
  are available in my <tt>~/bin/</tt> directory on a given system,
  or when simply trying to remember what
  some of my commands are called,
  I simply type a comma followed by <i>tab</i>
  and my list of commands appears:
</p>
<pre>$ ,<i>«tab»</i>
,complete-scp        ,go-thpgp            ,range
,complete-ssh        ,gr                  ,svn-store-password
,coreoff             ,hss                 ,umount
,coreon              ,mount-thpgp
,find                ,mount-twt</pre>
<p>
  I heartily recommend this technique
  to anyone with their own <tt>~/bin/</tt> directory
  who wants their command names kept clean, tidy,
  and completely orthogonal
  to any commands that the future might bring to your system.
  The approach has worked for me for something like a decade,
  so you should find it immensely robust.
  And, finally, it's just plain fun.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://www.righto.com/2024/06/montreal-mifare-ultralight-nfc.html">http://www.righto.com/2024/06/montreal-mifare-ultralight-nfc.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40769001">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6125267763462084907" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>To use the Montreal subway (the Métro), you tap a paper ticket against the turnstile and it opens.
The ticket works through a system called NFC, but what's happening internally?
How does the ticket work without a battery? How does it communicate with the turnstile?
And how can it be so cheap that you can throw the ticket away after one use?
To answer these questions, I opened up a ticket and examined the tiny chip inside.</p>
<p>The image below shows the chip inside the ticket, highly magnified.
The four golden squares in the corner are the connections to the antenna.
The tan-colored lines are the metal wiring layer on top of the chip; the thickest lines wire the antenna to other parts
of the chip.
The darker region that takes up the majority of the
chip is the chip's digital logic. To the left is the analog circuitry that handles the signal from the antenna.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/die-raw.jpg"><img alt="The MIFARE Ultralight die under the microscope.

(Click this image (or any other) for a larger view." width="500"></a></p><p>The MIFARE Ultralight die under the microscope. (Click this image (or any other) for a larger view.</p>
<p>The chip uses NFC (Near-Field Communication).
The idea behind NFC is that a reader (i.e. the turnstile) and an NFC tag (i.e. the ticket) communicate
over a short distance through magnetic fields, allowing them to exchange data.
The reader generates a magnetic field that both powers the tag and sends data to the tag.
Both the reader and the tag have coil-like antennas so the reader's magnetic field can be picked up by the tag.<span id="fnref:field"><a href="#fn:field">1</a></span>
When you tap your ticket on the turnstile, the NFC communication happens in 35 milliseconds, faster than an eyeblink.
The data provided by the NFC tag shows that you have a valid ticket and then you can enter the subway.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the subway ticket, made of printed paper.<span id="fnref:opus"><a href="#fn:opus">2</a></span>
At the right, the ticket appears to have golden smart-card contacts, like a
credit card with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV">EMV</a> chip.
However, those contacts are completely fake, just printed onto the card with ink, and there is no chip there.
Presumably, the makers thought that making the card look like a smart card would help people understand it.
The card actually uses an entirely different technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/occasionnelle-card.jpg"><img alt="A Montreal subway card. This card is for occasional use and is disposable. Regular travel uses a rigid plastic card containing a different chip." height="313" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/occasionnelle-card-w500.jpg" title="A Montreal subway card.

This card is for occasional use and is disposable. Regular travel uses a rigid plastic card containing a different chip.</p>
<p>Although the subway card is paper on the outside, its core is a thin plastic sheet, shown below.
The sheet has a coiled antenna made from a layer of metal foil.
If you look closely, you can see the tiny NFC chip in the lower right, a black speck
connected to two sides of the antenna wire.<span id="fnref:triple"><a href="#fn:triple">3</a></span>
The diagonal metal stripe in the upper left makes the antenna into a loop;
topologically, a spiral antenna won't work on a 2-D sheet, so the diagonal bridge completes the circuit.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize the absurdly small size of the chip: 570 µm × 485 µm.
The photo below shows that it is about the size of a grain of salt.
The chip is also extremely thin—75 µm or 120 µm—so you can't even feel the chip inside the ticket.</p>

I composited two images, one illuminated from above to show the die and one illuminated from below to show the salt.</p>
<h2>Functions of the chip</h2>
<p>There are many different types of NFC chips with varying levels of functionality. <span id="fnref:phone"><a href="#fn:phone">4</a></span>
This one is called the MIFARE Ultralight EV1,<span id="fnref:part"><a href="#fn:part">5</a></span> a low-cost chip designed
for one-time ticketing applications.
The basic function of the Ultralight chip is simple: providing a block of data to the reader.
The chip holds its data in a small EEPROM; this chip has 48 bytes of user memory, while another variant has 108 bytes of user memory.</p>
<p>The Ultralight chip lacks the cryptography support found in more advanced chips.
The Ultralight isn't much more secure than
a printed ticket with a QR code or barcode, like you'd download for a show.
It's up to the reader to validate the data and make sure the same ticket isn't being used multiple times.<span id="fnref:ticket"><a href="#fn:ticket">6</a></span></p>
<p>The Ultralight chip has a few features beyond a printed ticket, though.
The chips are manufactured with a unique 7-byte identification code (UID). Moreover, the UID is signed,
ensuring that fake UIDs cannot be generated.<span id="fnref:signed"><a href="#fn:signed">7</a></span>
The chip also supports password-protected memory access and locking of memory pages to prevent modification.
Since the password is transmitted without encryption, the security is weak, but better than nothing.<span id="fnref:upsell"><a href="#fn:upsell">8</a></span></p>
<p>Another interesting feature of the chip is the one-way counter. The chip has three 24-bit counters that can be incremented but not
decremented. The counters can be used to allow the ticket to be used a particular number of times, for instance.<span id="fnref:counters"><a href="#fn:counters">9</a></span></p>
<h2>Photographing the chip</h2>
<p>To photograph the chip, I went through several steps to remove the chip from the ticket and then strip the chip down
to the bare silicon.
First, to extract the plastic sheet with the chip and the antenna from the paper ticket, I simply soaked the ticket in water.
This turned the paper into mush, which could be scraped off to reveal the plastic core.
Next, I cut out a small square of plastic that included the chip and
put it in boiling sulfuric acid for about 30 seconds. This removed the plastic and adhesive, leaving the
silicon die.
(I try to avoid boiling acids, but processing a tiny chip like this only required a few drops of sulfuric acid,
minimizing the risk.)</p>
<p>The die was covered with a passivation layer to protect its surface, a sandwich of silicon nitride and PSG (phosphosilicate glass) 1.1 µm thick according to
the datasheet.
The chip's underlying circuitry was visible, but slightly hazy due to this layer.
I removed the passivation layer by boiling the chip in phosphoric acid for a few minutes.
The image below shows the chip after this step.
The top metal layer is much more visible, although some of the metal was dissolved by the acid.
The thick metal lines connect the four bond pads to various parts of the analog circuitry, while many thin vertical metal lines
provide interconnections of the logic circuitry.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/h3p04.jpg"><img alt="The die after treatment with phosphoric acid to remove the passivation layer. Click for a much larger version." height="441" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/h3p04-w500.jpg" title="The die after treatment with phosphoric acid to remove the passivation layer. Click for a much larger version." width="500"></a></p><p>The die after treatment with phosphoric acid to remove the passivation layer. Click for a much larger version.</p>
<p>Next, I treated the die with several cycles of treatment with Armour Etch to dissolve the oxide layer and hydrochloric acid to dissolve the metal.
I think the chip had three layers of metal wiring on top of the silicon.
Unfortunately, my process doesn't remove the metal layers cleanly, but causes them to come off in chaotic tangles.
Since I wasn't interested in tracing the circuitry layer-by-layer, this wasn't a significant problem.</p>
<p>With the metal layers and polysilicon removed, I was left with the bare silicon.
At this point, the underlying structure of the chip is visible.
The doped silicon regions show the transistors, although they are extremely small at this scale.
The white rectangles are capacitors. The chip has capacitors for many reasons: producing the right resonant frequency with
the antenna, filtering the power, and boosting the voltage with charge pumps.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/stripped2.jpg"><img alt="The die after stripping it down to the silicon." height="514" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/stripped2-w600.jpg" title="The die after stripping it down to the silicon." width="600"></a></p><p>The die after stripping it down to the silicon.</p>
<p>My biggest concern while processing this chip was to avoid losing it.
With a chip this small, bumping the chip or even breathing on it can send the chip flying perhaps never to be seen again.
Even trying to pick up the chip with tweezers is risky, since it can easily pop out and disappear.
It's no fun examining the floor, inch by inch, trying to figure out if a speck is the lost chip or a bit of dirt.
I found that the best way to move the chip between processing and a microscope slide was to put the chip in a few drops
of water and move it with a pipette.
Even so, there were a couple of times that I lost track of the chip and had to check some specks under the microscope to
determine which was the chip and which were dirt.</p>
<h2>Overview of the chip</h2>
<p>The block diagram below shows the high-level structure of the chip.
At the left, the antenna is connected to the RF interface, the analog circuitry that converts the high-frequency signals into digital data.
This circuitry also extracts power from the antenna's signal to power the chip.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/block-diagram.jpg"><img alt="Block diagram of the MIFARE Ultralight chip, from the datasheet." height="249" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/block-diagram-w600.jpg" title="Block diagram of the MIFARE Ultralight chip, from the datasheet." width="600"></a></p><p>Block diagram of the MIFARE Ultralight chip, from the <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF0ULX1.pdf">datasheet</a>.</p>
<p>The majority of the chip contains digital logic to process the 18 different commands that it can receive from the reader.
Some commands, such as <code>Wake-up</code> or <code>Halt</code> control the chip's state.
Other commands, such as <code>Read</code> or <code>Write</code> provide access to the EEPROM storage.
The specialized <code>Read_Cnt</code> and <code>Incr_Cnt</code> commands access the chip's counters.</p>
<p>The chip has an "intelligent anticollision function" that allows multiple cards to be read without conflict if they are
presented to the reader simultaneously.
If a conflict is detected, the reader uses a standard NFC algorithm to select the cards one at a time, based on their identification numbers.
The anticollision algorithm uses four of the chip's commands.</p>
<p>Finally, the chip has an EEPROM to store its data.
Unlike RAM, the EEPROM holds data even when unpowered; it is designed to hold data for 10 years.
To store data in the EEPROM, it must be written with a higher voltage than the rest of the chip uses.
The EEPROM interface circuit produces the necessary signals.</p>
<!-- White paper on NFC: https://scdn.rohde-schwarz.com/ur/pws/dl_downloads/dl_application/application_notes/1ma182/1MA182_5E_NFC_WHITE_PAPER.pdf -->

<p>The diagram shows the chip with its functional blocks labeled.
The majority of the die is occupied with digital logic; I'll explain below how it is implemented with standard-cell logic.
At the top is the EEPROM, a square of storage cells.
To the right of the EEPROM is a charge pump, a circuit to boost the voltage through switched capacitors.
The EEPROM interface circuitry is between the EEPROM and the digital logic.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/die-labeled.jpg"><img alt="The die, stripped down to the silicon, with presumed functional blocks labeled." height="464" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/die-labeled-w600.jpg" title="The die, stripped down to the silicon, with presumed functional blocks labeled." width="600"></a></p><p>The die, stripped down to the silicon, with presumed functional blocks labeled.</p>
<p>The remainder of the chip contains analog circuitry that is harder to interpret, so my labels are somewhat speculative.
The four bond pads are where the antenna is connected to the chip. There are four pads to support two parallel antennas if desired.
The first die photo shows the metal wiring between the bond pads and the structures that I've labeled as RF transistors and RF diodes.
The "RF transistors" in the upper left are large, oval-shaped structures.
These may be the transistors that send data back to the reader by modifying the load. Alternatively, they could be Zener diodes
to regulate the voltage powering the chip, since Zener diodes often have an oval shape.
The "RF diodes" at the bottom may rectify the signal from the antenna, producing the power for the chip.
The rectified signal is also demodulated and processed by the analog logic to extract the digital data sent from the reader.</p>
<h2>Sending data from the tag to the reader: load modulation</h2>
<p>You might expect the tag to send data back to the receiver by transmitting a signal through the antenna.
However, transmitting a signal takes power and the tag doesn't have much power available, just the power that it extracts from
the reader's signal.
Instead, the tag uses a clever technique called load modulation to send data to the reader.
The idea is that if the tag changes the load across the antenna, it will absorb more or less energy from the reader.
The reader can detect this change as a small variation in voltage across its transmitting antenna.
Thus, the tag can dynamically change its load to send data back to the reader.
Even though the signal produced by load modulation is extremely weak (80 dB less than the transmitted signal), the reader can detect it
and extract the data.</p>
<p>In more detail, the reader transmits at a carrier frequency of 13.56 MHz.<span id="fnref:standards"><a href="#fn:standards">10</a></span>
To send data back, the tag switches its load on and off at 848 kHz (1/16 of the carrier frequency), producing a subcarrier on top of the reader's signal.
To transmit bits, this load modulation is switched on or off to transmit 106 kilobits per second (1/8 of the modulation frequency).
The reader, in turn, extracts the subcarrier with a filter to receive the data bits from the tag.</p>
<!-- RFID Handbook p44 -->

<p>An NFC tag can apply a load that is either a resistor or a capacitor; a resistor absorbs the signal directly,
while a capacitor changes the antenna's resonant frequency and thus the amount of signal transferred to the tag.
The die contains many capacitors, but I didn't see any significant resistors, so I suspect that this chip uses a capacitor for the load.</p>
<h2>The chip's manufacturing process</h2>
<p>The image below shows an extreme closeup of the die. The red box surrounds a region of doped silicon, forming five MOS transistors
in series.
Each dark vertical line corresponds to the gate of one transistor so the width of this line corresponds to the feature size.
I estimate that the chip's feature size is 180 nm.
In comparison, the wavelength of visible light is 400-700 nm.
Since the features are smaller than the wavelength of light, it's not surprising that image appears blurry.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/closeup.jpg"><img alt="A closeup of the die, pushing the limits of my microscope." height="203" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/closeup-w300.jpg" title="A closeup of the die, pushing the limits of my microscope." width="300"></a></p><p>A closeup of the die, pushing the limits of my microscope.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/180_nm_lithography_process">180 nm process</a> was popular in the late 1990s.
These features are very large, however, compared to recent chips with features that are a few nanometers across.
At the time the MIFARE Ultralight EV1 chip was released (October 2012), the newest semiconductor manufacturing process was <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/22_nm_lithography_process">22 nm</a>,
so the 180 nm process they used was old even then.</p>
<p>However, it makes sense that the chip would be manufactured with an older process for several reasons.
First, much of the chip's area is occupied by analog circuitry and the four bond pads, so shrinking the digital logic
won't reduce the overall size much.
Moreover, a significantly smaller chip would be impractical to attach to the antenna; I expect even the current chip is a pain
to mount.
Finally, this chip is designed for the extremely low-cost (i.e. disposable) market, so the chip is manufactured as
inexpensively as possible.
With a more modern process, more chips would fit on a wafer, dropping the price, but manufacturing each wafer would be more expensive,
so there is a tradeoff.</p>

<h2>Standard-cell logic</h2>
<p>The chip's digital circuitry is implemented with standard-cell logic, a common way of implementing digital logic.
The idea behind standard-cell logic is to use automated tools to create the chip layout from a description of the
desired logic.
The process starts with a library of standard cells. Each cell is a standardized implementation of a simple circuit such
as a NAND gate or a flip-flop.
The cells are designed so they have a fixed height and can be arranged in rows.
The cells are then connected by metal wiring on top of the cells to produce the desired circuitry.
Although the resulting circuitry isn't as dense and efficient as a fully customized and optimized layout, standard cell logic is
much faster (and thus cheaper) to design than a hand-tuned layout.
Thus, standard-cell logic has been heavily used for integrated circuit design since the 1980s.</p>
<p>The photo below shows four rows of gates implemented with standard cell logic, 
The chip (like most modern chips) uses CMOS logic, with each logic gate built from two types of transistors: NMOS and PMOS.
To simplify manufacturing, the NMOS and PMOS transistors are arranged in separate rows.
Thus, each row of logic consists of a row of PMOS transistors on top and a row of NMOS transistors below, or vice versa.
Due to the physics of semiconductors, the PMOS transistors are larger, which allows the transistor types to be distinguished
in the image.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/standard-cells.jpg"><img alt="A closeup of the standard cell logic." height="291" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/standard-cells-w500.jpg" title="A closeup of the standard cell logic." width="500"></a></p><p>A closeup of the standard cell logic.</p>
<p>Looking at some of the cells and extrapolating, I estimate about 8000 gates in the logic section with about 45,000 transistors.
One question is if the chip is implemented as a hardcoded state machine, or if it contains a processor (microcontroller).
The transistor count is barely large enough to implement a simple microcontroller such as an 8051, but that wouldn't
leave many transistors left over for other necessary circuitry.
If a microcontroller were present, it would need software stored somewhere.
Given the simplicity of the protocol and the relatively small number of transistors, my guess is that the chip is
implemented in hardware (state machines and counters) rather than through a microcontroller.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows how a standard cell implements a 2-input NAND.
(This cell is from the <a href="https://www.righto.com/2024/01/intel-386-standard-cells.html">Intel 386</a>, not the NFC chip, but the
structures are similar.)
The cell contains four transistors. The yellow region is the P-type silicon that forms two PMOS transistors; the transistor gates are where the polysilicon (red) crosses the yellow region. (The middle yellow region is the drain for both transistors; there is no discrete boundary between the transistors.) Likewise, the two NMOS transistors are at the bottom, where the polysilicon (red) crosses the active silicon (green). The blue lines indicate the metal wiring for the cell.
The black circles are contacts, connections between the metal and the silicon or polysilicon. Finally, the well taps are the opposite type of silicon, connected to the underlying silicon well or substrate to keep it at the proper voltage.</p>

<h2>EEPROM</h2>
<p>The chip stores its data in an EEPROM, similar to flash memory.
The chip provides 640 or 1312 bits of EEPROM, based on the part number; I believe both versions use the same EEPROM implementation,
but the cheaper version limits the amount that can be used.
I think the EEPROM is the matrix shown below, with row and column drive circuitry to the right and below.
(The diagonal lines are accidental scratches while I was processing the chip.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/eeprom.jpg"><img alt="A closeup of the presumed EEPROM circuitry on the die." height="397" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/eeprom-w400.jpg" title="A closeup of the presumed EEPROM circuitry on the die." width="400"></a></p><p>A closeup of the presumed EEPROM circuitry on the die.</p>
<p>In the photo, the EEPROM appears to be a 64×64 grid, 4K bits of storage rather than the advertised 1312 bits.
There are several possible explanations.
First, I could be miscounting the capacity (it is easy to be off by a factor of 2, depending on the cell structure).
Second, the chip stores data that isn't reflected in the EEPROM memory map;
for instance, the one-way counters and the UID signature are not included in the EEPROM storage count.
Another possibility is that the extra EEPROM space holds code for a microcontroller (if the chip has one).</p>
<p>An EEPROM requires a relatively high voltage (10-20V) to force electrons into the storage cell for a bit. This voltage is generated by
a charge pump circuit that switches capacitors at high frequency to boost the voltage.
To the right of the EEPROM is a circuit with several large capacitors, presumably the charge pump.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>It's remarkable that these NFC chips can be manufactured so cheaply that they are disposable.
To keep the price down, the chips are sold by the wafer and then mounted in the tickets.<span id="fnref:tape"><a href="#fn:tape">11</a></span>
You can buy an eight-inch silicon wafer with the chips for $9000
from <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/nxp-usa-inc/MF0UL1101DUD-005/4020092">Digikey</a>.
This may seem expensive until you realize that a single wafer provides an astonishing
100,587 chips, yielding a per-chip price of nine cents.
According to the <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF0ULX1.pdf">datasheet</a>, a wafer has 103,682 potential good dies per wafer (PGDW).
Some dies will be faulty, of course, so the wafer comes with a file telling you which dies are the good ones, 97% of them.
(During the manufacturing of a typical chip, the faulty ones are marked with a spot of ink. But that won't work in this case since
each die is much smaller than an ink spot.)
If you need more chips, you can buy a <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/nxp-usa-inc/MF0UL1101DUD2A/8628260">12" wafer</a> for $19,000, providing 215,712 chips. 
A ticket manufacturer mounts each chip on an antenna sheet and then prints the ticket, adding a few cents to the cost of the ticket.
The result is an inexpensive ticket that can be used once and discarded.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with one last die photo.
In my first attempt at processing the chip, I treated it with Armour Etch. Although this failed to remove the passivation layer,
it thinned it slightly, enough to generate some wild colors due to thin-film interference.
I call this the "tie die".</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/hf1-b.jpg"><img alt="The die after treatment with Armour Etch." height="422" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/hf1-b-w500.jpg" title="The die after treatment with Armour Etch." width="500"></a></p><p>The die after treatment with Armour Etch.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Biden administration has published its proposed plan for preserving old-growth trees in national forests across the country, opening another opportunity for public input on conserving ancient trees.</p><p>The proposal, presented in a <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/project/?project=65356">draft environmental analysis</a> on Friday, outlines ways national forests should prioritize preserving old-growth trees, but it falls short of an outright ban on logging.</p><p>“This draft is a step, but the final policy must be significantly improved, including ending the practice of sending old-growth trees to timber mills,” several environmental groups, including the nonprofit Oregon Wild, said in a jointly issued <a href="https://mailchi.mp/pirg/statement-senate-passes-bill-to-expand-nuclear-power-2654276?e=9795462720">statement</a>.</p><p>Oregon Wild forest program manager Lauren Anderson called the proposal a good first step, but said it leaves too much up to individual forest managers, with loopholes allowing them to continue logging the country’s remaining ancient trees.</p><p>“There are very, very few reasons these days to cut down an old-growth tree,” Anderson told OPB. “Like if there’s an old-growth tree that’s threatening a popular recreation area or trail, that’s a reason to do it. But beyond that, there are very limited cases where it makes sense.”</p><p>Officials told the Associated Press that a sweeping ban on logging old-growth would make it harder to thin forests to protect communities against wildfires that have grown more severe as the planet warms.</p><p>“To ensure the longevity of old-growth forests, we’re going to have to take proactive management to protect against wildfire and insects and disease,” Forest Service Deputy Chief Chris French said.</p><p>Thinning forests — often called “proactive management” — can mean different things to different people, argued Eugene-based attorney Susan Jane Brown, who is helping develop a similar proposal for Northwest forests. For some forests, logging small-diameter trees ahead of prescribed burns is necessary, a consensus reached by many tribes and scientists.</p><p>“But you can take it too far,” Brown said. “That’s where some of the concern arises, is how much is enough and how much is too much. And in many places, that is in the eye of the beholder.”</p><p>The proposal doesn’t address whether some forests should be left alone without any thinning. Brown considers that a shortfall, particularly for moist forests west of the Cascades.</p><p>“Letting those forests continue to age and get older and more decadent,” Brown said. “That’s what the wildlife need them to do.”</p><p>The proposal stems from President Joe Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/04/22/executive-order-on-strengthening-the-nations-forests-communities-and-local-economies/">2022 executive order</a> calling for federal restrictions on logging old-growth and mature trees. The U.S. Forest Service responded in 2023, when it announced it would amend the plans used to manage all 128 of its forests in one fell swoop, something the agency has never done before.</p><p>The proposal issued Friday is the next step towards making that change.</p><p>Anderson said it doesn’t live up to Biden’s executive order, particularly since it doesn’t address how to protect mature trees — that is, large trees that aren’t quite old enough to be considered old growth.</p><figure><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/V7AZQNGD6ZBPDBYLLQA4VO2P7U.jpg?auth=67207aae67a7980336040bbd2ec77b84ea7301c661b9492370a3c92dddac9f45&amp;width=150" alt="FILE: This photo released by Oregon State University shows a marbled murrelet nesting on moss in a coastal forest.

That’s the plan that came out of the Pacific Northwest <a href="https://www.opb.org/show/timberwars/">timber wars</a> of the 1980s and ‘90s. It set aside 7.4 million acres in Oregon, Washington and California as protected reserves and banned clearcutting tree stands that were more than 80 years old within those reserves.</p><p>Brown is a member of an advisory committee developing recommendations for what that Northwest Forest Plan update could look like. She said changes to national U.S. Forest Service policies won’t heavily impact their work.</p><p>“The national amendment specifically recognizes and calls out the Northwest Forest Plan amendment as an ongoing process that should be consistent,” Brown said. “We’re just going to be more specific.”</p><p>Brown said many of the original Northwest Forest Plan protections for endangered species like the northern spotted owl and the marbled murrelet will remain in place. However, changes in the works will likely include new parameters for logging in some areas. She expects a draft proposal to publish in August.</p><p>Meanwhile, forests east of the Cascades could be in for even bigger changes with the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/wallowa-whitman/landmanagement/planning/?cid=stelprdb5247447">Blue Mountains Forest Plan revision</a>. That revision work is still in its early stages.</p><h2>Friday’s proposal does not include BLM lands</h2><p>Old-growth forest protections proposed Friday will apply to trees on public lands managed by the Forest Service, but not to the Bureau of Land Management. BLM has come <a href="https://www.portlandmercury.com/news/2024/06/20/47266821/activists-reignite-the-battle-for-oregons-old-growth-timber">under fire recently</a> for logging old-growth trees in Oregon.</p><p>BLM responded to Biden’s order through its <a href="https://www.blm.gov/public-lands-rule">public lands rule</a> approved in April, which nods to the benefits of old-growth trees.</p><figure><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/EC3AQGRSHZHMHJ72FWCF5GO5QQ.jpg?auth=3e19bcf28df786c70b58cfcb096c1911a236cf60661c8c36f09ef7d64963a652&amp;width=150" alt="FILE: A photo taken by protesters in May 2024 shows a tree-sitter's perch in the Bureau of Land Management's Rogue Gold Forest Management Project in southern Oregon.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>“Can you name the truck with four-wheel drive, smells like a steak, and seats 35?” </p>

<p>Back in 1998, “The Simpsons” joked about the Canyonero, an SUV so big that they were obviously kidding. At that time, it was preposterous to think anyone would drive something that was “12 yards long, two lanes wide, 65 tons of American Pride.”</p>

<p>In 2024, that joke isn’t far from reality.</p>

<p>And our reality is one where more pedestrians and bicyclists are getting killed on U.S. streets than at any time in the past 45 years – <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot">over 1,000 bicyclists and 7,500 pedestrians</a> in 2022 alone.</p>

<p>Vehicle size is a big part of this problem. A recent paper by urban economist <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=McWuIVkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Justin Tyndall</a> found that increasing the front-end height of a vehicle by roughly 4 inches (10 centimeters) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecotra.2024.100342">increases the chance of a pedestrian fatality by 22%</a>. The risk increases by 31% for female pedestrians or those over 65 years, and by 81% for children.</p>

<p>It’s hard to argue with physics, so there is a certain logic in blaming cars for rising traffic deaths. In fact, if a bicyclist is hit by a pickup truck instead of a car, Tyndall suggests that they are 291% more likely to die.</p>

<p>Yet automakers have long asserted that if everyone simply followed the rules of the road, nobody would die. Vehicle size is irrelevant to that assertion. </p>

<p>My discipline, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qRSev6sAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">traffic engineering</a>, acts similarly. We underestimate our role in perpetuating bad outcomes, as well as the role that better engineering can play in designing safer communities and streets. </p>

<h2>Millions of road deaths</h2>

<p>How bad are the bad outcomes? The U.S. has been tracking car-related road deaths since 1899. As a country, we hit the threshold of <a href="https://cdan.dot.gov/tsftables/Fatalities%20and%20Fatality%20Rates.pdf">1 million cumulative deaths</a> in 1953, 2 million in 1975 and 3 million in 1998. While the past several years of data have not yet been released, I estimate that the U.S. topped 4 million total road deaths sometime in the spring of 2024. </p>

<p>How many of those are pedestrians and bicyclists? Analysts didn’t do a great job of separating out the pedestrian and cyclist deaths <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/pedbike/03042/part2.cfm">in the early years</a>, but based on later trends, my estimate is that some 930,000 pedestrians and bicyclists have been killed by automobiles in the U.S. </p>

<p>How many of those deaths do we blame on big cars or bad streets? The answer is, very few. </p>

<p>As I show in my new book, “<a href="https://islandpress.org/books/killed-traffic-engineer#desc">Killed by a Traffic Engineer: Shattering the Delusion that Science Underlies our Transportation System</a>,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration calls road user error the “<a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/Publication/812506">critical reason” behind 94% of crashes, injuries and deaths</a>. </p>

<p>Crash data backs that up. </p>

<p>Police investigate crashes and inevitably look to see which road users, including drivers, pedestrians and cyclists, are most at fault. It’s easy to do because in almost any crash, road user error appears to be the obvious problem. </p>

<p>This approach helps insurance companies figure out who needs to pay. It also helps  automakers and traffic engineers rationalize away all these deaths. Everyone – except the families and friends of these 4 million victims – goes to sleep at night feeling good that bad-behaving road users just need more education or better enforcement. </p>

<p>But road user error only scratches the surface of the problem. </p>



<h2>Who creates dangerous streets?</h2>

<p>When traffic engineers build an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORzNZUeUHAM">overly wide street that looks more like a freeway</a>, and a speeding driver in a Canyonero crashes, subsequent crash data blames the driver for speeding. </p>

<p>When traffic engineers provide <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/07/12/bad-road-design-is-stoking-the-u-s-pedestrian-death-crisis-report">lousy crosswalks separated by long distances</a>, and someone jaywalks and gets hit by that speeding Canyonero driver, one or both of these road users will be blamed in the official crash report.</p>

<p>And when automakers build gargantuan vehicles that can easily go <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-speedometers-go-so-high-to-140-or-160-11">double the speed limit</a> and fill them with <a href="https://aaafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/VisualandCognitive.pdf">distracting touchscreens</a>, crash data will still blame the road users for almost anything bad that happens. </p>

<p>These are the sorts of systemic conditions that lead to many so-called road user errors. Look just below the surface, though, and it becomes clear that many human errors represent the typical, rational behaviors of typical, rational road users given the transportation system and vehicle options we put in front of them.</p>

<p>Look more deeply, and you can start to see how our underlying crash data gives everyone a pass but the road users themselves. Everyone wants a data-driven approach to road safety, but today’s standard view of crash data lets automakers, insurance companies and policymakers who shape vehicle safety standards off the hook for embiggening these ever-larger cars and light-duty trucks.</p>

<p>It also absolves traffic engineers, planners and policymakers of blame for creating a transportation system where for most Americans, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/07/07/why-cars-remain-so-appealing-even-in-cities-with-decent-public-transit/">only rational choice for getting around is a car</a>. </p>

            <figcaption><span>Transportation engineer Wesley Marshall explains why he believes traffic engineers systematically fail to design safer streets.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<h2>Understanding road behavior</h2>

<p>Automakers want to sell cars and make money. And if bigger SUVs seem safer to potential customers, while also being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/suv-sales-best-sellers.html">much more profitable</a>, it’s easy to see how interactions between road users and car companies – making seemingly rational decisions – have devolved into an SUV arms race. </p>

<p>Even though these same vehicles are <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Charles-M-Farmer-43373119">less safe for pedestrians, bicyclists and those in opposing vehicles</a>, the current data-driven approach to road safety misses that part of the story. </p>

<p>This can’t all be fixed at once. But by pursuing business as usual, automakers and traffic engineers will continue <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abm3427">wasting money</a> on <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/11/07/awful-pedestrian-shaming-campaign-gets-the-smackdown-it-deserves">victim-blaming campaigns</a> or billboards placed high over a road telling drivers to <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/05/02/study-distracting-roadside-safety-billboards-may-cause-17k-crashes-a-year">pay attention to the road</a>.</p>

<p>A better starting point would be remaking the U.S.’s allegedly data-driven approach to road safety by reinventing our understanding of the crash data that informs it all.</p>

<p>The key is starting to ask why. Why did these road users act as they did? Why didn’t they follow the rules that were laid out for them? Bad road user behavior shouldn’t be excused, but a bit of digging below the surface of crash data unearths a completely different story. </p>

<p>Figuring out which road user is most at fault may be useful for law enforcement and insurance companies, but it doesn’t give transportation engineers, planners, policymakers or automakers much insight into what they can do better. Even worse, it has kept them from realizing that they might be doing anything wrong.</p>

                    I am a simple midwesterner living in the middle of New York City. I put my shoes on one at a time, I apologize when I bump into people on the street, and I use <a href="https://universe.roboflow.com/test-y7opj/drop-of-a-a-hat">AI inference</a> to drop hats on heads when they stand outside my apartment. Like anybody else.

                <p>
                    I have extremely high foot traffic outside my window. I see a sea of uncovered heads in the sun. I believe <a href="https://dropofahat.zone/">DropofaHat.zone</a> will become the first of many window based stores. Here a busy New Yorker can book a 5 minute time slot, pay for a hat, stand in a spot under my window for 3 seconds, have a hat put on their head, and get on with their extremely important, extemely busy day all within a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Minute">New York minute</a>.

                <h3 id="window">Just Opening the Window</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a challenge. My window only opens about 4 inches. If I couldn't figure this out, my entire business had no chance. There must have been some kind of key or screw I had to take off to let it open, but I saw no sign of anything other than some very tiny slots on the bottom.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/window.d1a328d997c6.JPG" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I could just look up what kind of window I had, I figured I could find out what kind of lock goes with it. This turned out to be pretty confusing. I think I have a double pane awning? Maybe? Every type of window can look like many other types.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/window2.8a0dcfd284cf.png" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    I finally resorted to just googling "window keys" and going through all the images of ones that looked like they could somehow fit my window. Most looked like they needed a lock until I came across this weird shape.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/window3.f3bb609205d0.png" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>I was fully expecting to buy a dozen other keys but this one actually worked!</p>
                <h3 id="hat">The Hat</h3>
                <p>
                    Next was deciding what hats I am going to drop and sell. My window is pretty high. It needed to be a hat that wouldn't hurt someone or fly into traffic.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/hat2.4fc278102b4c.JPG" alt="">

                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided I needed something to signify the future. Something that would look beautiful as it gracefully fell out of a window onto your head.

                    Propeller Hats! And this one has a stylish Eagle to represent the flying it is about to do.
                </p>
                <h3 id="mechanism">The Dropping Mechanism</h3>
                <p>
                    This was the simplest thing to get working. I had a Raspberry Pi and an  stepper motor lying around so I decided to put them to work.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/drop.d24c2e99f284.JPG" alt="">
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/drop2.a9598cc0e964.gif" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    After imagining some extra sharp blades on tiny motor somehow cutting yarn, I realized I could just wrap the yarn around the stepper motor and have it move slightly. I had a giant camera gimbal to test on and was fully prepared to stick it out the window when I realized the string could just hang over the window with this method.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/drop3.55217f88855c.jpeg" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    I literally copied this out of the Adafruit tutorial for the stepper motor. This is a single python file on the Raspberry Pi that the computer will run when the AI determines someone is standing in the right spot and ready to receive their hat.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <p>On the Raspberry Pi as "dropHat.py"</p>
                    </div>
                <h3 id="ai">The AI</h3>
                <p>
                    I figured the AI would be the hardest part but it was surprisingly quick. I put a webcam out over the window and wanted to have inference run live on the video. I wanted the AI to literally show me what it was seeing. This would allow me to potentially live stream the feed later. And also it just seemed really cool to watch. This is what the full webcam stream looks like.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/ai4.ec5c1fd32041.JPG" alt="">
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/AI2.543a0d3e2667.JPG" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    I selected object detection for the initial model and then recorded a couple minutes of pedestrians walking under my window with their hatless heads. Then it was time to annotate images. I only wanted the model to tell me when someone was on the exact sidewalk square directly under my window. I put the class and prompt "person" and a lot of annotating was done for me automatically. The rest I dragged a box around the person if they were on the right part of the sidewalk or marked as null if not.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Obviously, your window view will look different from mine so you will have to record a few minutes and upload your own.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/ai5.b79e2a160088.png" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    The model seemed to work well with only 133 images annotated. I made sure there was a mix of positive and null ones. Since I only cared about a really small section the sidewalk, I added a pre-processor step of cropping the image.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/ai6.fc23c8944162.png" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this worked, I realized I would bump the webcam every now and then so I wanted a more generalized model. I removed the cropping and it worked oddly well. It only "detected" the image when it was in the spot I wanted. Even though I only tried it with one person in the annotating, it already worked on whoever walked by.
                </p>
                
                
                <div><p>
                    Now we have to run a python program on the computer running your webcam. I want this code to do 2 things:
                    </p><ol>
                        <li>Confirm someone is standing in the correct spot for 3 seconds straight</li>
                        <li>Call the Raspberry Pi after the 3 seconds have passed.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>
                    On your computer with the webcam, pip install the inference library and the SSH libraries I used
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This is the entire python file. You will have to put in your own API key. I want mine to stay in the free tier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It works by calling the model every second and if it confirms someone is in that spot 3 seconds in a row, it will SSH into my Raspberry Pi and run the function dropHat.py.
                </p>

    <h5>Abstract</h5>
    <p>Byzantine consensus is a fundamental building block in distributed cryptographic problems. Despite decades of research, most existing asynchronous consensus protocols require a strong trusted setup and expensive public-key cryptography. In this paper, we study asynchronous Byzantine consensus protocols that do not rely on a trusted setup and do not use public-key cryptography such as digital signatures. We give an Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocol whose security is only based on cryptographic hash functions modeled as a random oracle. Our protocol has $O(\kappa n^3)$ total communication and runs in expected $O(1)$ rounds. The fact that we use only cryptographic hash functions also means that our protocol is post-quantum secure. The minimal use of cryptography and the small number of rounds make our protocol practical. We implement our protocol and evaluate it in a geo-distributed setting with up to 128  machines. Our experimental evaluation shows that our protocol is more efficient than the only other setup-free consensus protocol that has been implemented to date. En route to our asynchronous consensus protocols, we also introduce new primitives called asynchronous secret key sharing and cover gather, which may be of independent interest.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>llama.ttf is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model.</p>
      <h3>Ehm, what?</h3>
      <p>llama.ttf is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model.</p>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <h3>How?</h3>
      <div><p>
        The font shaping engine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarfBuzz">Harfbuzz</a>, used in applications such as Firefox and Chrome,
        comes with a <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/docs/wasm-shaper.md">Wasm shaper</a> allowing arbitrary code to be
        used to "shape" text.
        
        </p><p>
        In particular, this "arbitrary" code could in principle be an entire LLM inference engine with trained parameters bundled inside,
        relying on treating text containing magic symbols for fake "ligatures" to initialize the LLM and use it to generate text.
        </p><p>
        It could also in principle be an entire LLM inference engine (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama_(language_model)">Llama</a>
        in our case, hence the name) except instead of only being in principle it's what this is.
        </p><p>
        At the end of the day, what this means is that you can just use the font to run the LLM and e.g. get text generation in <i>any</i>
        Harfbuzz-based application; your favorite text editor/email client/whatever without having to wait for the vendor to include
        the "Copilot"-like features that everyone is rushing to implement these days. And everything runs
        completely locally. So perhaps this silly hack is in fact a billion dollar idea!? This also means that you can use your font to
        chat with your font.
      </p></div>
      <h3>Okay show me</h3>
      <p>So in case that doesn't make sense (after all, does it?), here's an attempt to make it make more sense:</p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4bOyYctgFI?si=XAAcj3uf02vxdXwM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
      <p>Skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4bOyYctgFI#t=6m09s">6:09</a> if you just want to see the font in action.</p>
      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>Just download <a href="https://github.com/fuglede/llama.ttf/raw/master/llamattf/llama.ttf">llama.ttf</a> (60 MB download, since it's based on the 15M parameter TinyStories-based model) and use it like you would any other font. Use it somewhere where Harfbuzz is used and built with Wasm support.</p>
      <h3>More fun with fonts</h3>
      <p>If this didn't seem pointless enough, here are some other weird things people have done with fonts and LLMs:
        </p><ul>
          <li>tom7's Super Metroid speedrun documentation-inspired language for formatting text nicely with LLMs: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y65FRxE7uMc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y65FRxE7uMc</a></li>
          <li>Erk's presentation on programmable fonts with Harfbuzz-Wasm, very much an inspiration for this one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms1Drb9Vw9M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms1Drb9Vw9M</a></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Some truths about the Universe and our experience in it seem immutable. The sky is up. Gravity sucks. Nothing can travel faster than light. Multicellular life needs oxygen to live. Except we might need to rethink that last one.</p>
<p>In 2020, scientists discovered a jellyfish-like parasite that doesn't have a mitochondrial genome – the first multicellular organism ever found with such an absence. That means it doesn't breathe; in fact, it lives its life completely free of oxygen dependency.</p>
<p>This discovery doesn't just change our understanding of how life can work here on Earth – it could also have implications for the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Life started to develop the ability to metabolize oxygen - that is, respirate - sometime <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-origin-of-mitochondria-14232356/">over 1.45 billion years ago</a>. A larger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea">archaeon</a> engulfed a smaller bacterium, and somehow the bacterium's new home was beneficial to both parties, and the two stayed together.</p>
<p>That symbiotic relationship resulted in the two organisms evolving together, and eventually those bacteria ensconced within became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle">organelles</a> called mitochondria. Every cell in your body except red blood cells has large numbers of mitochondria, and these are essential for the respiration process.</p>
<p>They break down oxygen to produce a molecule called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate">adenosine triphosphate</a>, which multicellular organisms use to power cellular processes.</p>
<p>We know there are adaptations that allow some organisms to thrive in low-oxygen, or hypoxic, conditions. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26323757">Some single-celled organisms have evolved</a> mitochondria-related organelles for anaerobic metabolism; but the possibility of exclusively anaerobic multicellular organisms had been the subject of some scientific debate.</p>
<p>That was, until a team of researchers led by Dayana Yahalomi of Tel Aviv University in Israel decided to take another look at a common salmon parasite called <em><a href="https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/henneguya.pdf">Henneguya salminicola</a></em>.</p><p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2020-02/h-salminicola.jpg" alt="h salminicola" width="700" loading="lazy"><span>(Stephen Douglas Atkinson)</span></span></p><p>It's a cnidarian, belonging to the same phylum as corals, jellyfish, and anemones. Although the cysts it creates in the fish's flesh are unsightly, the parasites are <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/sports/oregonian/bill_monroe/2015/08/post_197.html">not harmful</a>, and will live with the salmon for its entire life cycle.</p>
<p>Tucked away inside its host, the tiny cnidarian can survive quite hypoxic conditions. But exactly how it does so is difficult to know without looking at the creature's DNA – so that's what the researchers did.</p>
<p>They used deep sequencing and fluorescence microscopy to conduct a close study of <em>H. salminicola</em>, and found that it had lost its mitochondrial genome. In addition, it also lost the capacity for aerobic respiration, and almost all of the nuclear genes involved in transcribing and replicating mitochondria.</p>
<p>Like the single-celled organisms, it had evolved mitochondria-related organelles, but these are unusual too – they have folds in the inner membrane not usually seen.</p>
<p>The same sequencing and microscopic methods in a closely related cnidarian fish parasite, <em>Myxobolus squamalis</em>, was used as a control, and clearly showed a mitochondrial genome.</p>
<p>These results showed that here, at last, was a multicellular organism that doesn't need oxygen to survive.</p>
<p>While <em>H. salminicola </em>is still something of a mystery, the loss is pretty consistent with an overall trend in these creatures – one of genetic simplification. Over many, many years, they basically devolved from a <a href="http://news.ku.edu/2015/11/06/researchers-sequence-genomes-parasite-actually-micro-jellyfish">free-living jellyfish ancestor</a> into the much more simple parasite we see today.</p><p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2020-02/h-salminicola-monochrome-sm.jpg" alt="h salminicola monochrome sm" width="700" loading="lazy"><span>(Stephen Douglas Atkinson)</span></span></p><p>They've lost most of the original jellyfish genome, but retained – oddly – a complex structure resembling jellyfish stinging cells. They don't use these to sting, but <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09955-y">to cling to their hosts</a>: an evolutionary adaptation from the free-living jellyfish's needs to the parasite's. You can see them in the image above – they're the things that look like eyes.</p>
<p>The discovery could help fisheries adapt their strategies for dealing with the parasite; although it's harmless to humans, no one wants to buy salmon riddled with tiny weird jellyfish.</p>
<p>But it's also a heck of a discovery for helping us to understand how life works.</p>
<p>"Our discovery confirms that adaptation to an anaerobic environment is not unique to single-celled eukaryotes, but has also evolved in a multicellular, parasitic animal," the researchers <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1909907117">explained</a> in their paper, published in February 2020.</p>
<p>"Hence, <em>H. salminicola</em> provides an opportunity for understanding the evolutionary transition from an aerobic to an exclusive anaerobic metabolism."</p>
<p>The research was published in <em><a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1909907117">PNAS</a></em>.</p><p><em>An earlier version of this article was published in February 2020.</em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://quic.video/blog/never-use-datagrams/">https://quic.video/blog/never-use-datagrams/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40766079">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>Click-bait title, but hear me out.</p>
<h2 id="tcp-vs-udp">TCP vs UDP</h2>
<p>So you’re reading this blog over the internet.
I would wager you do a lot of things over the internet.</p>
<p>If you’ve built an application on the internet, you’ve undoubtedly had to decide whether to use TCP or UDP.
Maybe you’re trying to make, oh I dunno, a live video protocol or something.
There are more choices than just those two but let’s pretend like we’re a networking textbook from the 90s.</p>
<p>The common wisdom is:</p>
<ul>
<li>use <strong>TCP</strong> if you want <strong>reliable</strong> delivery</li>
<li>use <strong>UDP</strong> if you want <strong>unreliable</strong> delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>What the fuck does that mean?
Who <em>wants</em> unreliability?</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t want a hard-drive that fails 5% of writes.</li>
<li>You don’t want something with random holes in the middle (unless it’s cheese).</li>
<li>You don’t want a service that is randomly unavailable because ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nobody* wants memory corruption or deadzones or artifacts or cosmic rays.
Unreliability is a consequence, not a goal.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://quic.video/blog/never-use-datagrams/glitch.gif" alt="Video glitch"></p><figcaption><p>*Unless you’re making some cursed GIF art.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art">Source</a></p></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<p>So what do we actually want?</p>
<p>If you go low enough level, you can use electrical impulses to do neat stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power on LEDs in a desired configuration.</li>
<li>Spin magnets at ludicrous speeds.</li>
<li>Make objects tingle and shake.</li>
<li>etc you get the idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>But we don’t want to deal with electrical impulses.
We want higher level functionality.</p>
<p>Fortunately, software engineering is all about standing on the shoulders of others.
There are layers on top of layers on top of layers of abstraction.
Each layer provides properties so you don’t have to reinvent the personal computer every time.</p>
<p>Our job as developers is to decide which shoulders we want to stand on.
But some shoulders are awful, so we have to be selective.
Over-abstraction is bad but so is under-abstraction.</p>
<p>What user experience are we trying to build, and how can we leverage the properties of existing layers to achieve that?</p>
<h2 id="unreliable">“Unreliable”</h2>
<p>There was a recent <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/moq/meetings/">MoQ interim</a> in Denver.
For those unaware, it’s basically a meetup of masochistic super nerds who want to design a live video protocol.
We spent hours debating the semantic differences between <strong>FETCH</strong> and <strong>SUBSCRIBE</strong> among other riveting topics.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://quic.video/blog/never-use-datagrams/denver.jpeg" alt="Denver interim"></p><figcaption><p>I’m the one in the back right corner, the one with the stupid grin on their face.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>A few times, it was stated that <strong>SUBSCRIBE</strong> should be <em>unreliable</em>.
The room cringed, and I hard cringed enough to write this blog post.</p>
<p>What I actually want is <strong>timeliness</strong>.
If the internet can choose between delivering two pieces of data, I want it to deliver the newest one.</p>
<p>In the live video scenario, this is the difference between buffering and skipping ahead.
If you’re trying to have a conversation with someone on the internet, there can’t be a delay.
You don’t want a buffering spinner on top of their face, nor do you want to hear what they said 5 seconds ago.</p>
<p>To accomplish timeliness, the live video industry often uses UDP datagrams instead of TCP streams.
As does the video game industry apparently.
But why?</p>
<h2 id="datagrams">Datagrams</h2>
<p>A datagram, aka an IP packet, is an envelope of 0s and 1s that gets sent from a source address to a destination address.
Each device has a different maximum size allowed, which is super annoying, but 1200 bytes is generally safe.
And of course, they can be silently lost or even arrive out of order.</p>
<p>But the physical world doesn’t work in discrete packets; it’s yet another layer of abstraction.
I’m not a scientist-man, but the data is converted to analog signals and sent through some medium.
It all gets serialized and deserialized and buffered and queued and retransmitted and dropped and corrupted and delayed and reordered and duplicated and lost and all sorts of other things.</p>
<p>So why does this abstraction exist?</p>
<h2 id="internet-of-queues">Internet of Queues</h2>
<p>It’s pretty simple actually: something’s got to give.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://quic.video/blog/never-use-datagrams/bodies.jpeg" alt="Screamer Rock"></p><figcaption><p>Let the packets hit the FLOOR</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>When there’s too much data sent over the network, the network has to decide what to do.
In theory it could drop random bits but oh lord that is a nightmare, as evidenced by over-the-air TV.
So instead, a bunch of smart people got together and decided that routers should drop at packet boundaries.</p>
<p>But why drop packets again?
Why can’t we just queue and deliver them later?
Well yeah, that’s what a lot of routers do these days since RAM is cheap.
It’s a phenomenon called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufferbloat">bufferbloat</a> and my <a href="https://discord.com/">coworkers</a> can attest that it’s my favorite thing to talk about. 🐷</p>
<p>But RAM is a finite resource so the packets will eventually get dropped.
Then you finally get the <strong>unreliability</strong> you wanted all along…</p>
<h2 id="oh-no">Oh no</h2>
<p>Oh shit, I forgot, I actually want <strong>timeliness</strong> and bufferbloat is the worst possible scenario.
Naively, you would expect the internet to deliver packets immediately, with some random packets getting dropped.
However bufferbloat causes <em>all</em> packets to get queued, possibly for seconds, ruling out any hope of timely delivery.</p>
<p>How do you avoid this?
Basically, the only way to avoid queuing is to detect it, and then send less.
The sender uses some feedback from the receiver to determine how long it took a packet to arrive.
We can use that signal to infer when routers are queuing packets, and back off to drain any queues.</p>
<p>This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control">congestion control</a> and it’s a huge, never ending area of research.
I briefly summarized it in the <a href="https://quic.video/blog/replacing-webrtc">Replacing WebRTC</a> post if you want more CONTENT.
But all you need to know is that sending packets at unlimited rate is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://quic.video/blog/never-use-datagrams/bbr.png" alt="BBR"></p><figcaption><p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/99/materials/slides-99-iccrg-iccrg-presentation-2-00.pdf">Source</a>:

<h2 id="you-the-application-developer">You, The Application Developer</h2>
<p>Speaking of a recipe for disaster.
Let’s say you made the mistake of using UDP directly because you want them datagrams.
You’re bound to mess up, and you won’t even realize why.</p>
<p>If you want to build your own transport protocol on top of UDP, you “need” to implement:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-packetization-and-reliabili">retransmissions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002.html#name-congestion-control">congestion control</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And if you want a great protocol, you also need:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001">encryption</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002.html#name-estimating-the-round-trip-t">RTT estimates</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-streams">multiplexing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And if you want an AMAZING protocol, you also need:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport_API">web support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-matching-packets-to-connect">port reuse</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-datagram-size">dynamic MTUs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-multipath/">multi-path</a></li>
<li><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-load-balancers/">stateless load balancing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#section-9.6.1">anycast load balancing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s be honest, you don’t even know what half of those are, nor why they are worth implementing.
Just use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC">QUIC</a> library instead.</p>
<p>But if you still insist on UDP, you’re actually in good company with a lot of the video industry.
Building a live video protocol on top of UDP is all the rage; for example, <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://www.haivision.com/products/srt-secure-reliable-transport/">SRT</a>, <a href="https://nscreenmedia.com/amazon-buys-sye/">Sye</a>, <a href="https://www.rist.tv/">RIST</a>, etc.
With the exception of Google, it’s very easy make a terrible protocol on top of UDP.
Look forward to the upcoming <strong>Replacing RTMP <em>but please not with SRT</em></strong> blog post!</p>
<h2 id="timeliness">Timeliness</h2>
<p>But remember, I ultimately want to achieve <strong>timeliness</strong>.
How can we do that with QUIC?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid bloating the buffers</strong> 🐷.
Use a delay-based congestion controller like <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-cardwell-iccrg-bbr-congestion-control-01.html">BBR</a> that will detect queueing and back off.
There are better ways of doing this, like how WebRTC uses <a href="https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/native-code/rtp-hdrext/transport-wide-cc-02/README.md">transport-wide-cc</a>, which I’ll personally make sure gets added to QUIC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Split data into streams</strong>.
The bytes within each stream are ordered, reliable, and can be any size; it’s nice and convenient.
Each stream could be a video frame, or a game update, or a chat message, or a JSON blob, or really any atomic unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritize the streams</strong>.
Streams are independent and can arrive in any order.
But you can tell the QUIC stack to focus on delivering important streams first.
The low priority streams will be starved, and can be closed to avoid wasting bandwidth.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it.
That’s the secret behind <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/moq/about/">Media over QUIC</a>.
Now all that’s left is to bikeshed the details.</p>
<p>And guess what?
This approach works with higher latency targets too.
It turns out that the fire-and-forget nature of datagrams only works when you need real-time latency.
For everything else, there’s QUIC streams.</p>
<p>You don’t need datagrams.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://quic.video/home/quic.svg" alt="QUIC logo"></p></figure>
<h2 id="in-defense-of-datagrams">In Defense of Datagrams</h2>
<p><strong>Never* use Datagrams</strong> got you to click, but the direction of QUIC and MoQ seems to tell another story:</p>
<ol>
<li>QUIC <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9221">has support for datagrams</a> via an extension.</li>
<li>WebTransport <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-webtrans-http3-08#section-3.1-6">requires support for datagrams</a>.</li>
<li>The latest MoQ version <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-moq-transport-02.html#object-message-formats">adds support for datagrams</a>.</li>
<li>The next MoQ version <a href="https://github.com/moq-wg/moq-transport/pull/384">will require support for datagrams</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like all things designed by committee, there’s going to be some compromise.
There are some folks who think datagram support is important.
And frankly, it’s trivial to support and allow people to experiment.
For example, OPUS has FEC support built-in, which is why MoQ supports the ability to send each audio “frame” as a datagram.</p>
<p>But it’s a trap.
Designed to lure in developers who don’t know any better.
Who wouldn’t give up their precious UDP datagrams otherwise.</p>
<p>If you want some more of my hot-takes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The next <a href="https://quic.video/blog/forward-error-correction">blog post about FEC in OPUS</a>, and why layers are important.</li>
<li>The previous <a href="https://quic.video/blog/quic-powers">blog post gushed over QUIC</a>, except for the datagram extension which is frankly terrible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is no conclusion.
This is a rant.</p>
<p>Please don’t design your application on top of datagrams.
Old protocols like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> get a pass, but be like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS">DNS over HTTPS</a> instead.</p>

He was raised in Cape Town, and started his academic life at the University of Cape Town in 1962. After a year, he’d earned a Beit Scholarship and began studying natural sciences at Cambridge. Potter’s academic excellence was apparently rivaled by very few as he was awarded a Commonwealth Scholarship to continue his education at Imperial College London. He earned his doctorate in computational physics, joined the staff, and wrote a textbook that remained on the Oxford reading list for over thirty years.

When the microprocessor was invented and varieties of chips were made available for retail purchase, Potter immediately recognized the impact that these devices would have, or at the very least, could have. Potter began reading computer magazines, researching the market, and attempting to identify opportunities while earning money in a variety of ways: driving trucks, selling encyclopedias, selling ice cream. He was aware of both CPU and Sinclair Research, and he called them up. What he saw was a seemingly endless market for software, and he also noticed that there were already people writing software. So, Potter approached those folks and offered a non-exclusive deal in which he’d package their software and sell it more widely taking twelve percent for himself. For this endeavor, Potter started a company, Psion, in 1980. The name somewhat unofficially stood for Potter Scientific Instruments Or Nothing, but this was due to PSI having already been a business name; officially, the name was just Psion. His first offices were located on Baker Street in London, most of his early employees were former students of his, and the company had little money resorting to renting a typewriter as they lacked the funds for anything else.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1d4fd7-56be-48c5-af73-316eb917562d_220x102.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1d4fd7-56be-48c5-af73-316eb917562d_220x102.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1d4fd7-56be-48c5-af73-316eb917562d_220x102.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1d4fd7-56be-48c5-af73-316eb917562d_220x102.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1d4fd7-56be-48c5-af73-316eb917562d_220x102.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1d4fd7-56be-48c5-af73-316eb917562d_220x102.png" width="726" height="336.6" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ce1d4fd7-56be-48c5-af73-316eb917562d_220x102.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:102,&quot;width&quot;:220,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:726,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1d4fd7-56be-48c5-af73-316eb917562d_220x102.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1d4fd7-56be-48c5-af73-316eb917562d_220x102.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1d4fd7-56be-48c5-af73-316eb917562d_220x102.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1d4fd7-56be-48c5-af73-316eb917562d_220x102.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The Psion logo</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The first majorly successful products sold by Psion were games developed in-house for the Sinclair ZX81.

The ZX81 used a Zilog Z80 clocked at 3.25MHz, had 1K RAM, could display sixty four by fortyu eight pixels, and required an external tape player/recorder for any storage. Despite these limitations, Psion managed to develop a flight simulator that modelled the basic bits of flying a twin engined propellor plane. The game displayed an instrument panel and windowed horizon.

Most software for the ZX81 required the 16K RAM pack, but Psion released a 1K version of Chess (though there was a much more playable 16K version too). The company released a few dual sided tapes. For example, their </span><em>Fantasy Games</em><span> tape contained </span><em>Perilous Swamp</em><span> on side A, and </span><em>Sorcerer’s Island</em><span> on side B. Both of these were text adventures. Beyond games, the company did release Vu-Calc, and Vu-File productivity titles.</span></p><p>The ZX81 and the ZX Spectrum were successful enough that writing software for these machines was commercially successful. To fascilitate their software development efforts, Psion purchased a VAX minicomputer running VMS (was most likely a VAX 11/780). Having developed and released Vu-Calc and Vu-File, the company was working to develop a productivity suite. This suite was comprised of Abacus, Archive, Easel, and Quill. Abacus was a spreadsheet, Archive was a flat-file database, Easel was a charting tool, and Quill was a word processor. These were developed on the VAX for the Sinclair QL which was released on the 12th of&nbsp;January in 1984.</p><p>Potter and several other folks from Psion were sharing some pints at a greek place in London and discussing the lack of portability in computing. They were also quite frustrated that any loss in power would result in the loss of one’s working data. Perhaps the booze, perhaps the right combination of people in the right setting, or more likely the right amount of alochol with the right people in the right setting… a sketch was made on a napkin of a device to solve the problems. In June of 1984, Psion released the Organiser. This was a handheld, eight bit microcomputer based around the HD3601X (a Hitachi manufactured, CMOS, Motorola 6800) clocked at 900kHz with 2K SRAM and 4K ROM (the RAM, ROM, and CPU were all a single chip, and that 2K RAM is all that the CPU could directly address). The machine had a sixteen character, single line, liquid crystal display. Unlike other hand held computers of its day, the Organiser had mass storage available in the form of Datapaks which were essentially EPROMs of either 8K or 16K, and it could hold two Datapaks at once. Datapaks were write-once media until taken to service center where they could be erased with UV. These were seen by the system as serial devices, and therefore complicated and slowed data access. Specifically, were a program to require data at position two hundred, for example, the program would likely set the read position to zero and then step forward two hundred times. Given the speed of the EPROMs, this wasn’t too bad for the time period, but it was slower than it could have been using something other than a serial bus. An entire 16K Datapak could be searched in five seconds with most operations being far shorter.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226d01a6-660e-4fbe-877a-77717d12be1c_752x570.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226d01a6-660e-4fbe-877a-77717d12be1c_752x570.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226d01a6-660e-4fbe-877a-77717d12be1c_752x570.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226d01a6-660e-4fbe-877a-77717d12be1c_752x570.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226d01a6-660e-4fbe-877a-77717d12be1c_752x570.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226d01a6-660e-4fbe-877a-77717d12be1c_752x570.png" width="752" height="570" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/226d01a6-660e-4fbe-877a-77717d12be1c_752x570.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:570,&quot;width&quot;:752,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:227403,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226d01a6-660e-4fbe-877a-77717d12be1c_752x570.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226d01a6-660e-4fbe-877a-77717d12be1c_752x570.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226d01a6-660e-4fbe-877a-77717d12be1c_752x570.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226d01a6-660e-4fbe-877a-77717d12be1c_752x570.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Psion Organiser, image from November 1984 issue of BYTE</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>There were some extremely clever tricks played with this device to get around some technological limitations of the time period. The HD6301X added power management and sleep states to the 6800. These were leveraged extensively. With no active process being run but the device switched on, the CPU clock would be frozen. A deeper sleep mode could then be enabled which would turn off the display. Yet, this machine did not have a proper real-time clock… it faked it. Given the extreme power efficiency it otherwise had, the Organiser had a counter and specific RAM location for time. Every seventeen minutes and four seconds, the device would add one thousand twenty four seconds to that memory thereby updating the time. This also meant that even its deepest sleep state, the machine would wake briefly to update the time. When the device was fully active, the time/date appeared to be handled by an RTC, but it was still just incrementing seconds. Regarding those sleep states and the like, the device was powered by a single 9V alkaline cell yielding around six months of </span><em>normal use</em><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb47962c4-b630-4731-9c1a-5cdb6d4b4a30_1695x1397.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb47962c4-b630-4731-9c1a-5cdb6d4b4a30_1695x1397.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb47962c4-b630-4731-9c1a-5cdb6d4b4a30_1695x1397.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb47962c4-b630-4731-9c1a-5cdb6d4b4a30_1695x1397.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb47962c4-b630-4731-9c1a-5cdb6d4b4a30_1695x1397.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb47962c4-b630-4731-9c1a-5cdb6d4b4a30_1695x1397.jpeg" width="1456" height="1200" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b47962c4-b630-4731-9c1a-5cdb6d4b4a30_1695x1397.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1200,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Series 1 Image Gallery - Jaap's Psion Organiser II Page&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Series 1 Image Gallery - Jaap's Psion Organiser II Page" title="Series 1 Image Gallery - Jaap's Psion Organiser II Page" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb47962c4-b630-4731-9c1a-5cdb6d4b4a30_1695x1397.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb47962c4-b630-4731-9c1a-5cdb6d4b4a30_1695x1397.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb47962c4-b630-4731-9c1a-5cdb6d4b4a30_1695x1397.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb47962c4-b630-4731-9c1a-5cdb6d4b4a30_1695x1397.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Psion Organiser with a coin for scale and also with color.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This computer didn’t really have an operating system. Given the 4K ROM, there really wasn’t enough room to have anything too sophisticated. At power-on, the device will display the clock/calendar, and the user can press the mode key to clear the display. As for programs, the Organiser shipped with the already mentioned clock/calendar, a calculator, and a flat file database. The database had dedicated keys just for it which minimized the amount of typing that would need to be done by the user. Records in the dattabase were up to two hundred characters long. So, the user would hit the mode key until the enter mode came up, and then type in a record. Hitting save then obviously commits the data to a Datapak. Hitting the Find key allows a user to search for a given record with partial matching supported. For this tiny display, some allowances were made. For example, once scrolling left or right is started, the device will continue to scroll until another key is hit. Delete will always delete to the right unless there is nothing to the right, and then it will delete to the left. The calculator wasn’t exactly feature rich. It was a simple four function calculator, but it did support floating point.</p><p><span>Yet, this was a </span><em>real</em><span> computer. The Organiser had the POPL programming language available for it via an application pack (takes one of the Datapak slots). The language was simple and limited with any given procedure being limited to two hundred characters total, lines being limited to one hundred characters total, and RAM available for data being limited to three hundred fifty six bytes total. Of course, other applications were offered for the device, but they all were rather simple given the device’s limitations. For some more interesting usage, remember that the Datapak slots were essentially ports. A Datapak-format communications interface and program was available as the Communications pack allowing connection to another computer or to a modem with the ability to set baud rate, parity, and so on. Things like finance programs, slightly more complicated math, physics, and so on were all available.</span></p><p><span>As cool as the organizer was, it was extremely limited in pretty much every way. Psion had got many things right in the first go, as reviewers were quick to admit, and that made iterating on the design somewhat easy. The Organiser II CM released in 1986 was built on the Hitachi HD6303X (Motorola 6803) clocked at 920kHz with 8K RAM and 32K ROM. The screen was a much improved dot matrix LCD with two lines of sixteen characters. This version also shipped with a little piezo beeper built in, and an expansion slot on the top. The expansion slot could allow for a wired power adapter, a serial cable, a bar code reader, a telephone dialer, and even </span><a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/02/07/arduino-nano-adds-usb-interface-to-the-psion-organiser-ii/" rel="">a USB port</a><span>. Given the reputation of the first model for ruggedness and the coverage of the same quality in the second model, this particular model sold quite well to companies who needed handheld computers for inventory and other purposes. The Organizer II XP launched the same year, and this model had 32K RAM and a backlit screen while otherwise being the same machine. Given that both of these models had significantly more RAM than their predecessor, the programming capabilities were greatly enhanced with a new language, </span><a href="https://opl-dev.sourceforge.net/" rel="">OPL</a><span>, which was similar to BASIC.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d1a1d45-94f1-4cf5-9c8f-e1df6a379996_500x751.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d1a1d45-94f1-4cf5-9c8f-e1df6a379996_500x751.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d1a1d45-94f1-4cf5-9c8f-e1df6a379996_500x751.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d1a1d45-94f1-4cf5-9c8f-e1df6a379996_500x751.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d1a1d45-94f1-4cf5-9c8f-e1df6a379996_500x751.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d1a1d45-94f1-4cf5-9c8f-e1df6a379996_500x751.jpeg" width="726" height="1090.452" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3d1a1d45-94f1-4cf5-9c8f-e1df6a379996_500x751.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:751,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:726,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d1a1d45-94f1-4cf5-9c8f-e1df6a379996_500x751.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d1a1d45-94f1-4cf5-9c8f-e1df6a379996_500x751.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d1a1d45-94f1-4cf5-9c8f-e1df6a379996_500x751.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d1a1d45-94f1-4cf5-9c8f-e1df6a379996_500x751.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Psion Organizer II LZ</figcaption></figure></div><p>With the success of the Organizer II in 1986, Psion launched a slightly more updated version in 1988, the Psion Organizer II LZ. This model had 64K RAM and a 64K ROM with OPL built-in, and some more advanced features for the database. The calculator functions were also expanded. The display of the LZ was also better; it was still a dot matrix LCD with one bit per pixel, but now it had four lines with twenty characters per line (as opposed to sixteen) and a character set of two hundred thirty two characters (all previous models had a character set of two hundred characters). By 1988, Datapaks of larger sizes were available for the Organizer line. I am not certain when each new size came out, or perhaps they were all released around the same time? Either way, Datapaks of 32K, 64K, and 128K all made their way to market.</p><p>On the 26th of September in 1989, Psion released the MC200, MC400, and MC600.

Of course, there was also a 12V mains adapter of the wall wart variety available. The machines could concurrently make use of up to four hot-swappable solid state disks, either writable or ROM. All three models also included a touchpad for pointer control. Oddly, this touchpad operated more similarly to graphics tablet where the location tapped on the pad is where the pointer would move (more or less) on the screen. These machines also featured a voice processor that allowed users to record and playback notes, or leave dictation for a typist. The voice chip apparently allowed for rather efficient compression of speech with eight minutes of voice being stored in just 64K of either central or secondary memory. Naturally, this meant that all three models featured both a speaker and microphone. They all additionally featured serial ports allowing connection to a PC, modem, or other device. For connection to a PC, Psion also offered PsiWin software. Which would synchronize data between the Psion applications and PC applications.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fa49ca5-d9cc-465f-a478-a6ba923734f2_1200x900.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fa49ca5-d9cc-465f-a478-a6ba923734f2_1200x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fa49ca5-d9cc-465f-a478-a6ba923734f2_1200x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fa49ca5-d9cc-465f-a478-a6ba923734f2_1200x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fa49ca5-d9cc-465f-a478-a6ba923734f2_1200x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fa49ca5-d9cc-465f-a478-a6ba923734f2_1200x900.jpeg" width="1200" height="900" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5fa49ca5-d9cc-465f-a478-a6ba923734f2_1200x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fa49ca5-d9cc-465f-a478-a6ba923734f2_1200x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fa49ca5-d9cc-465f-a478-a6ba923734f2_1200x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fa49ca5-d9cc-465f-a478-a6ba923734f2_1200x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fa49ca5-d9cc-465f-a478-a6ba923734f2_1200x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Close up view of a MC400 with 128K flash, image from retrocosm.net</figcaption></figure></div><p>The specifications varied for RAM and display. The MC200 featured 128K RAM and a display resolution of six hundred forty by two hundred pixels, the MC400 had 640K RAM and a display resolution of six hundred forty by four hundred pixels, and the MC600 was capable of grayscale CGA and had 768K RAM. With those differences, battery life was quoted as seventy five hours, sixty hours, and thirty hours respectively.</p><p>The MC200 and MC400 ran an operating system called EPOC. This system was written in C and 8086 assembly language, was single-user, fully preemptively multitasked, and designed to run in ROM. This system was also fully graphical, and it had an OPL interpreter. Interestingly, EPOC would pre-load the built-in applications to make things a bit quicker.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

ROM. This allowed the use of things like Lotus 1-2-3, WordStar, and dBase and could be purchased with up to 1MB of RAM and further expanded to 3MB of RAM. This also meant that the MC600 wasn’t really a sixteen bit organizer like the other two, but more a super power efficient PC-compatible laptop that happened to have some organizer style software on it. The MC600, despite its differences, also still supported PsiWin.</p><p>Unfortunately, these machines were extremely expensive. The MC400 cost around $1268 at launch which would be roughly $3206 in 2024. The MC600 was about double that price. Adding to this, the software wasn’t truly ready at launch with many promised features not appearing until software updates were released the following year. The cost and incomplete feature set hurt sales and almost took the company out of business.</p><p>The company wasn’t idle despite their struggles. The company was working on EPOC software while also continuing hardware development. The next computer models were the HC 100, 110, and 120 shipping with EPOC in 1991. These three handheld models that would serve in industrial use cases, warehouses, and stores.

What it really needed was a the right combination of hardware features and pricing to get a successful consumer product. The handheld computers did well in segments requiring the form factor, but the laptop style computers did poorly. Psion decided to attempt merging the two to make one of the first palm top computers. In September of 1991, Psion released the Series 3. The Psion Series 3 was built around an NEC V30 CPU clocked at 4.7MHz, with 128K or 256K RAM, two SSD slots, a screen of two hundred forty by eighty pixels measuring three and eight tenths by one and a half inches, and used just two AA batteries yielding an eighty hour run time.

This was followed by the Series 3mx in 1998. The 3mx brought with it an NEC V30MX clocked at 27.684 MHz, upped the minimum RAM to 1MB, increased the serial connector’s speed, and added a backlit screen. To ensure compatibility with earlier software, the clock speed could be reduced by pressing ctl + capslock. The 3mx was the final 16 bit organiser (SIBO) released by Psion. With the original and all of the variants, these SIBO devices sold roughly one and a half million units. The relatively high sales volume coupled with the improvements to software development tools led to more than fifteen hundred third party software titles being developed for the platform. This was a huge milestone in mobile computing software.</p><p><span>Starting in November of 1994, perhaps fearing the Apple Newton which released in August of 1993, Colly Myers at Psion began working on a 32 bit version of EPOC written primarily in C++ for </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/mips-for-the-masses?utm_source=publication-search" rel="">ARM</a><span> CPUs. With two other software engineers helping complete it, the kernel of this operating system was first successfully booted in the summer of 1995. This was a single-user, fully pre-emptive multitasking operating system with memory protection. Unlike the 16 bit version of EPOC, this system was available for other manufacturers to license for their own hardware. This new version of EPOC debuted on the 16th of June in 1997 with the Psion Series 5 while the first licensed product, the Geofox One, launched a little later in October. The Series 5 was built around a Cirrus Logic PS7110 CPU operating at 18.432 MHz. For a comparison of performance, think of an Intel 80486 clocked at 33 MHz. Of course, this wasn’t x86 but rather ARM7, and it only drew 20mA with a standy mode utilizing just 3 µA. The PS7110 was capable of addressing 1GB of RAM, but I do not believe any system ever used that. The Series 5 had a ROM of 6MB, RAM of 4MB or 8MB, an RS232 port, an IrDA port, a microphone, an internal speaker, a compact flash slot, a backlit touchscreen LCD of six hundred forty by two hundred forty pixels capable of sixteen color gray scale, and a keyboard that had real keys. All of this was powered by two AA batteries with a runtime of ten to twenty hours.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Anyone using the modem, however, would want to use mains power as the device would otherwise devour batteries the way yours truly devours a low country boil. Another major difference is that the Geofox shipped with EnRoute which was an early navigation program. When combined with a PCMCIA card GPS receiver, the Geofox One became a competent competitor to a Garmin. Of the two, the Series 5 did well and the Geofox One did not.  Geofox sold around a thousand units and the company went out of business.</p><p>The 16 bit hardware and software had been created by small teams. The 32 bit hardware and software saw the company grow to well over a hundred engineers most of whom were in their twenties or thirties. They were young enough to be enthusiastically creative and this shows in some choices in EPOC32. No user ever really had to worry about selecting a specific place to save things, dialog boxes were flat and navigated by the arrow keys, and simple English language was used throughout the entire system. Being object oriented, some rather sophisticated stuff was possible. For example, a user could draw a stethoscope into Agenda to represent a doctor’s meeting. Most applications were drag-and-drop aware as well. This meant that a user could drag and drop a to-do list onto the Agenda’s day view with a set time. Thanks to EPOC32 these new ARM-based machines could serve as the netbooks of their era offering web browsers, email clients, and instant messengers. Rather quickly the software market began to expand, and within just a year or two of launch, EPOC32 had things like ZX Spectrum emulators available for it. </p><p>Despite how well thought out both the hardware and software were, a competitor had sprung from the soil of the USA, Palm. Early in Palm’s life, they’d actually tried to get acquired by Psion, but Psion had little interest. The Palm Pilot appeared to be little more than an electric day planner while Psion was making handheld computers. Unfortunately, the USA had quickly become the land of the PC. An inexpensive companion device whose data would easily sync with a PC running Windows 95 and Outlook 97 was extremely attractive to people in the US, and the Palm Pilot was the fastest selling computer product in history in 1997. As for competing with computers more generally and not just the handheld space, PC compatibles were conquering the Earth and Psion’s own data synchronization capabilities didn’t seem to count for much when trying to fight Palm. Then… this was also becoming the time of mobile phones, and those phones were swiftly gaining handheld computing capabilities. Over the years, Psion had compartmentalized as it grew. The company had Psion Computers working on the palm top devices, Psion Enterprise working on the handheld machines, and Psion Software working on EPOC. A decision was made to spin out Psion Software as its own company, and one hundred thirty Psion employees found themselves working for a newly formed Symbian Ltd on the 24th of June in 1998. This new company was a joint venture from Psion, Nokia, Motorola, and Ericsson with each receiving about a quarter of the ownership. Goldman Sachs estimated that the company was worth around $150 million. Colly Myers was put in place as the CEO, Potter as Chairman, and the rest of the operational leadership was comprised of former Psion folks. Naturally, aside from Potter, the rest of the ownership of the company consisted of folks from Nokia, Motorola, and Ericsson. So, the owners of the company were also customers of the company. </p><p>The first mission of Symbian was to get as many licensees as possible to prevent them from signing with Microsoft. This was a conscious move on the part of the Symbian leadership, and perhaps not without reason. Symbian did get quite a few licensees, and this was partially due to pricing. The company asked just £5 for each smartphone. This pricing model was the only pricing model regardless of the size of the licensee.</p><p>Psion followed the Series 5 with the 5mx in June of 1999. The 5mx used an ARM710T clocked at 36 MHz, a 10MB ROM, and 16MB of RAM. Otherwise, it was largely the same as the Series 5 that preceded it. In time for the launch, the company had significantly improved its application suite with Contacts, Word, Sheet, Email and so on being able to synchronize with Outlook, Lotus Organizer, Microsoft Schedule Plus, Lotus cc:mail, and Exchange via PsiWin. The PsiWin synchronization software also allowed users to perform full backups of their Psion EPOC32 device, or drag and drop files back and forth while viewing the Psion as an external hard disk. For those users of Outlook Express or other unsupported applications, there was an ecosystem of add-on software to support the synchronization of data with more PC applications.</p><p>In late November of 1999, the company released a successor to to the Series 5mx, the Revo. This machine was a slimmed down and lighter version of the 5mx with slightly smaller and non-backlit screen, no compact flash slot, and no voice stuff. The keyboard had a new design, and it was well received, but the screen, lack of expansion, and lack of voice features hurt the device’s reception. This device’s reveal took place at a Psion press event in London and the company had brought in Stephen Fry as the compere. To his dismay, no effort had been put into Apple Macintosh support for the device either… and that was Fry’s first question to the Psion reps present. I imagine the mood of the event was significantly dampened with that opening.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2293b8b6-a9f7-4ae1-ba30-d5a9d0daa87f_1920x1440.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2293b8b6-a9f7-4ae1-ba30-d5a9d0daa87f_1920x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2293b8b6-a9f7-4ae1-ba30-d5a9d0daa87f_1920x1440.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2293b8b6-a9f7-4ae1-ba30-d5a9d0daa87f_1920x1440.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2293b8b6-a9f7-4ae1-ba30-d5a9d0daa87f_1920x1440.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2293b8b6-a9f7-4ae1-ba30-d5a9d0daa87f_1920x1440.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2293b8b6-a9f7-4ae1-ba30-d5a9d0daa87f_1920x1440.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;undefined&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="undefined" title="undefined" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2293b8b6-a9f7-4ae1-ba30-d5a9d0daa87f_1920x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2293b8b6-a9f7-4ae1-ba30-d5a9d0daa87f_1920x1440.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2293b8b6-a9f7-4ae1-ba30-d5a9d0daa87f_1920x1440.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2293b8b6-a9f7-4ae1-ba30-d5a9d0daa87f_1920x1440.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Psion Revo</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Psion netBook launched in late 1999 aimed at the mobile enterprise market.

The screen was now a seven and seven tenths inches, color, backlit, touch-sensitive, LCD with a resolution of six hundred forty by four hundred eighty pixels.

product, and the Series 7 launched in early 2000 (though some units may have shipped in late 1999) as the higher-end device. The Series 7 was extremely similar to the netBook that preceded it for the enterprise space. The CPU was clocked lower at 132.71MHz, the RAM was cut in half, IBM MicroDrive support wasn’t available, and it was lighter. The Macintosh support was a little better than that of the Revo, but from what I understand, it was still far behind the support for Windows.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a84ca6c-1daa-4b00-84f1-8e74bcf92630_650x539.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a84ca6c-1daa-4b00-84f1-8e74bcf92630_650x539.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a84ca6c-1daa-4b00-84f1-8e74bcf92630_650x539.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a84ca6c-1daa-4b00-84f1-8e74bcf92630_650x539.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a84ca6c-1daa-4b00-84f1-8e74bcf92630_650x539.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a84ca6c-1daa-4b00-84f1-8e74bcf92630_650x539.jpeg" width="726" height="602.0215384615385" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a84ca6c-1daa-4b00-84f1-8e74bcf92630_650x539.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:539,&quot;width&quot;:650,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:726,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Psion Series 7&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Psion Series 7" title="Psion Series 7" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a84ca6c-1daa-4b00-84f1-8e74bcf92630_650x539.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a84ca6c-1daa-4b00-84f1-8e74bcf92630_650x539.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a84ca6c-1daa-4b00-84f1-8e74bcf92630_650x539.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a84ca6c-1daa-4b00-84f1-8e74bcf92630_650x539.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Psion Series 7, image from the Register</figcaption></figure></div><p>Given that the Revo was obviously not going to live up to the Series 3 or the Series 5, the company released the Revo Plus in September of 2000. This was much the same machine as the Revo but with 16MB of RAM instead of 8MB,  and two embedded, rechargable, 700mAh NiMH batteries as opposed to conventional and removable alkalines. On the software side of things, the Revo Plus had support for SMS, and it included the Opera web browser by default. None of this addressed the issues present in the Revo, obviously, and many felt that the Series 5 or even Series 3 were the better options for the budget conscious.</p><p>In 2000, Psion acquired Teklogix to rejuvinate its enterprise lineup and attempt to get back to its own roots. Fairly swiftly, the Teklogix brand and products became Psion Teklogix. The devices that resulted from this acquisition were unique for Psion in that they were x86 and ran Windows.</p><p>On the 25th of June in 2001, Psion released its first Chinese-market device, the 618C, which was essentially a Chinese-localized Revo. That same year the netBook was re-released as the netBook Pro with a spec bump and Windows CE. The final, traditional, Psion machine was released on the 28th of September in 2001, the NetPad. This was something of a cross between Psion’s industrial handheld machines and the Psion netBook, and it was aimed at the industrial sector. It was built around the Intel’s StrongARM clocked at 206MHz. It had 16MB of ROM and 16MB SDRAM. It was powered by a 875mAh lithium-ion battery yielding about ten hours of operating time between charges, but a larger battery pack of 1400mAh was available. The device did have a cell for RAM data retention in the event of power loss, likely handy for people working in a warehouse and not near a charger. It’s display was six hundred forty by two hundred forty pixels with backlight, touch, and color. This time, however, the device could switch between landscape and portrait.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

It lacked ethernet, bluetooth, USB, and the like, but it did have IrDA, RS232, an MMC/SD card slot, and optional WiFi or cellular connectivity. The first release of the Psion netPad used Symbian and packed many familiar applications to EPOC32 users like Word, Sheet, Time, Alarms, Calculator, Voice Recorder, Opera, and the like, but it also included Java. It was capable of instant messenging, fax, email (smtp, pop3, imap4), HTTP 1.1 (HTML 3.2, Java Applets, JS, SSL, GIF/JPG), and it still supported PsiWin with conversions of native document formats to those of MS Office or Lotus SmartSuite as well as synchronization with Outlook and Exchange. Later versions of the netPad switched to using Windows CE as did the later netBook Pro.</p><p>Back at Symbian, in 1998, Scott Jenson who’d worked on the original Newton’s design joined the new company. He, Juha Christensen and Nick Healey wanted to be certain that a variety of devices with different form factors and methods of interaction could make use of the operating system. To this end, they came up with six different device reference family designs (DFRDs) with names based on gemstones. These were emerald, sapphire, ruby, pearl, quartz, and crystal. This was then reduced to five, and then to three. Pearl was the single-hand device family, quartz was the stylus type device family, and crystal was the QWERTY keyboard device family. Each of these device types had its own graphical user interface, and its own assumptions about how users would interact with the UI. The quartz interface was initially designed and built at Ericsson’s design lab in Ronneby, Sweden. That lab was acquired by Symbian and the design came with it. The crystal design was built by Nokia, and it was never actually shared with anyone as far as I know. For anyone wishing to license it, he/she would have needed to approach Nokia, but there were some loose clones of that design, and it was… something of a hostile replacement of designs made by Symbian.</p><p><span>Symbian was very much not Psion, and for the employees, this became obvious within the first year. The Psion staff had been accustomed to running with radical designs, getting them to market, and working on the </span><em>next thing </em><span>immediately after. This didn’t happen at Symbian. Meetings were long, never seemed to reach conclusive decisions, and Ericsson and Nokia weren’t really quick to accept anything from Symbian. Nokia slowly began to flex its muscles to control the company as it quickly rose to be the largest mobile phone vendor on Earth. Within eight months of joining, Nick Healey left the company. Yet, for all of the other players in the market, Symbian operated as a consultancy where they could take a reference design and adapt it to a customer’s hardware and give it a unique look and feel. This became a decent revenue source for Symbian. Given that all of these custom designs were being made, the DFRDs eventually became redundant and were largely superseded. In November of 2001 at COMDEX, Nokia unveiled the Series 60 interface with the Nokia 7650, and it essentially killed the Pearl design.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d16328d-a505-46a7-9099-2397c0b4e519_1092x1756.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d16328d-a505-46a7-9099-2397c0b4e519_1092x1756.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d16328d-a505-46a7-9099-2397c0b4e519_1092x1756.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d16328d-a505-46a7-9099-2397c0b4e519_1092x1756.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d16328d-a505-46a7-9099-2397c0b4e519_1092x1756.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d16328d-a505-46a7-9099-2397c0b4e519_1092x1756.jpeg" width="1092" height="1756" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2d16328d-a505-46a7-9099-2397c0b4e519_1092x1756.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1756,&quot;width&quot;:1092,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Notable moments in Nokia camera phone history (pictures) - CNET&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Notable moments in Nokia camera phone history (pictures) - CNET" title="Notable moments in Nokia camera phone history (pictures) - CNET" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d16328d-a505-46a7-9099-2397c0b4e519_1092x1756.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d16328d-a505-46a7-9099-2397c0b4e519_1092x1756.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d16328d-a505-46a7-9099-2397c0b4e519_1092x1756.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d16328d-a505-46a7-9099-2397c0b4e519_1092x1756.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The Nokia 7650 with the Series 60 UI</figcaption></figure></div><p>This phone was a big deal. It was the first mass market Symbian OS device, the first phone from Nokia with camera (VGA resolution), the first Nokia phone with MMS, and it packed bluetooth and GPRS. It worked with both Java and EPOC applications, and it was released on the 26th of June in 2002. It was popular, sold really well, and made Symbian OS beat both Palm OS and Windows CE in the European market. This phone and its software largely set the standard feature set for early smartphones.</p><p>Psion Software and the early days of Symbian were filled with problem solvers who had backgrounds in natural sciences, mathematics, audio engineering, and related fields. The company didn’t much care whether or not the person had a degree, a background in computing, or even any familiarity with company and its products. They really just wanted the best people, and this led to a creative and vibrant company that focused on its products. The Nokia dominated Symbian was more similar to other megacorporations with which we are all somewhat familiar. It hired computer science graduates who lacked experience and were familiar with Symbian’s software. Management began to take more control and dissent wasn’t tolerated. Most of the folks who commented on the time period relate that the politics were annoying, meetings were somewhat hostile, innovation wasn’t encouraged, and that former Psion folks were leaving all the time. By 2002, Christensen had left for Microsoft, and Myers left that year to found IssueBits. Despite the tumult, Symbian picked up more licensees including Arima, Fujitsu, Sharp, and BenQ.</p><p>In September of 2003, Motorola sold its stake in Symbian to Psion and Nokia. This was followed by Psion’s exit in February of 2004. Psion’s stake was split among Nokia, Matsushita, Siemens, and Sony Ericsson with the deal being finalized in July of 2004. At that time, Nokia held 47.9% of the company.</p><p>By 2007, Symbian OS was powering about two thirds of the mobile market, and Nokia acquired it in 2008. Following the acquisition, Nokia setup a non-profit, the Symbian Foundation, to which it donated both its S60 platform and all of Symbian Ltd’s assets. The hope was that the Symbian Foundation would develop and open source operating system that could power the mobile space without royalties. This move was a bit late. The iPhone had launched, and Android had just been unveiled. Still, Symbian was still king, and it was adapted to compete. For example, Nokia released the 5800 XpressMusic in late 2008, and it had… a rather familiar UI.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b690fbe-23fa-4a63-a03b-bfa04b6f5a90_730x506.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b690fbe-23fa-4a63-a03b-bfa04b6f5a90_730x506.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b690fbe-23fa-4a63-a03b-bfa04b6f5a90_730x506.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b690fbe-23fa-4a63-a03b-bfa04b6f5a90_730x506.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b690fbe-23fa-4a63-a03b-bfa04b6f5a90_730x506.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b690fbe-23fa-4a63-a03b-bfa04b6f5a90_730x506.jpeg" width="730" height="506" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7b690fbe-23fa-4a63-a03b-bfa04b6f5a90_730x506.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:506,&quot;width&quot;:730,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b690fbe-23fa-4a63-a03b-bfa04b6f5a90_730x506.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b690fbe-23fa-4a63-a03b-bfa04b6f5a90_730x506.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b690fbe-23fa-4a63-a03b-bfa04b6f5a90_730x506.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b690fbe-23fa-4a63-a03b-bfa04b6f5a90_730x506.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic</figcaption></figure></div><p>Symbian lost its majority status in the last three months of 2010 to Android when 33.3 million Android devices were shipped. Around this time, the Symbian Foundation faultered. It became a licensing operation only with no permanent staff, and Nokia brought development of Symbian in-house. Nokia was losing its way, and they knew it. Nokia’s CEO, Steven Elop, said in a memo:</p><blockquote><p><em>While competitors poured flames on our market share, what happened at Nokia? We fell behind, we missed big trends, and we lost time. At that time, we thought we were making the right decisions; but, with the benefit of hindsight, we now find ourselves years behind.</em></p><p><em>[…]</em></p><p><em>We have some brilliant sources of innovation inside Nokia, but we are not bringing it to market fast enough. We thought MeeGo would be a platform for winning high-end smartphones. However, at this rate, by the end of 2011, we might have only one MeeGo product in the market.</em></p></blockquote><p>Well, in 2011, Nokia handed over development of Symbian to Accenture, and they pivoted to Windows Phone 7, Psion was acquired by Motorola in 2012 for $200 million (though they’d been out of Symbian for quite some time), and the last Symbian device was made by Nokia in 2013, the 808 PureView.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89a43435-c05b-474c-879d-7bef136bfeb5_1063x740.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89a43435-c05b-474c-879d-7bef136bfeb5_1063x740.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89a43435-c05b-474c-879d-7bef136bfeb5_1063x740.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89a43435-c05b-474c-879d-7bef136bfeb5_1063x740.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89a43435-c05b-474c-879d-7bef136bfeb5_1063x740.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89a43435-c05b-474c-879d-7bef136bfeb5_1063x740.webp" width="1063" height="740" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/89a43435-c05b-474c-879d-7bef136bfeb5_1063x740.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:740,&quot;width&quot;:1063,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Nokia 808 PureView specs, review, release date - PhonesData&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Nokia 808 PureView specs, review, release date - PhonesData" title="Nokia 808 PureView specs, review, release date - PhonesData" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89a43435-c05b-474c-879d-7bef136bfeb5_1063x740.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89a43435-c05b-474c-879d-7bef136bfeb5_1063x740.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89a43435-c05b-474c-879d-7bef136bfeb5_1063x740.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89a43435-c05b-474c-879d-7bef136bfeb5_1063x740.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This final device was built around an ARM11 CPU clocked at 1.3GHz and a Broadcom BCM2763 GPU that supported OpenGL ES 2.0.

<p>Recently I had to go on journey into the Vector Database world and pick one for a particular project. And oh boy, was it a ride. Recently Vector Databases have gained a newfound attraction and spotlight thanks to the rise of LLMs. Such situation is both a blessing and a little bit of a curse, bringing some of the things attributed to LLMs to Vector Databases too - the perception they are 'a new thing', untested technology or some shiny crap good only for LLM-based stuff. All of which is wrong.</p>
<p>Vector Databases have been with us for waaay longer than most know. There's legit engineering, science and rigorous testing behind most of them over the span of multiple years. And there's a lot of them, they all have their own quirks, just a little bit like RDBMSes do, except the situation there is quite clear, at least for me, in most cases postgres FTW, I mean it's not 2005 anymore, we won't go with mysql or LAMP stack, right? Do most of you even remember what it is or am I exaggerating things?</p>
<p>In case of Vector Databases I was, and still am, actually, completely green. So I had to go around, gather facts, check stuff out and form my opinion regarding each particular database, as to select one for my particular use case.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let me put a disclaimer here. I do not title myself as an expert in AI. There are all my just personal ramblings, opinions, certainly biased. Take everything you read with a grain of salt and do your own due dilligence.</p>
<h2>Introduction to Vectors, Similarity and our amazing brains</h2>
<p>Before we actually begin I think we should dig a bit deeper into what exactly we are playing around. If you are not interested in understanding how this all works in detail and how it relates to generative AI, feel free to skip this part and go over to the next section.</p>
<p>First we must lay down certain axioms (smart word for the common sense/ground rules we all agree upon and accept as true). </p>
<p>One of such would be the fact that currently computers do not really understand words. They operate in what is called binary language, so a string of 0s and 1s. It's related to how electric charge, electrons and atoms work. Physics stuff. Very basics of CS and electronics.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ol>
<li>Computers do not understand words, they operate on binary language, which is just 1s and 0s, so numbers. Computers only understand numbers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Knowing that, it becomes obvious, that we may face some problems. First of all if it's all just 1 or 0, how do we express different numbers? Well, that part is easy, because thanks to the decimal counting system. Long story short, we have 10 digits to express stuff, in binary you have 2. That means that you still can represent other numbers with base 2, the resulting number will be just a bit longer and calculated differently. I won't to into too much of a detail here, you can look it up yourself -&gt; binary system, decimal system and how to convert from one to another. Or ask chatgpt for an explanation. It does a fine job. Just know that any natural number can be easily converted from base ten to binary e.g. "4" in decimal i s "100" in binary. They hold equivalent value, but are expressed differently. The case is a bit more complicated for floating point numbers, but let's not get into that now.</p>
<p>So first layer of abstraction is down. We have computers. Electric. Electrons. High current/low current, current/no current. 1s and 0s. </p>
<p>These 1s and 0s of ours now can magically become numbers. This is what our computers operate on - in every case. When you dig deep enough, everything you interact with in the virtual world is in fact a number, so a particular configuration of these tiny little something's in the computer that either have electricity running through them, or they don't and that is interpreted as a number. Imagine 3 light bulbs. 1st is on, 2nd and 3rd are off. 1-0-0. We magically agreed that this means 4. Now make the size smaller probably by a thousand, a milion times or something, and you get an idea what's going on in that shiny macbook of yours. Back to the topic.</p>
<p>Numbers. Yes, we have then and are able to somehow interpret the current state of your computer, or it's part as it being a particular number.</p>
<p>Now that's not very useful, right? We, humans, mostly operate on text and language, right? Yup. Imagine a world where you have to decode numbers. in some magic dictionary to a word. The computers wouldn't be so useful now, would they? But that's how it looks in the background. Long time ago some smart dudes have gathered around that agreed that from now on, if we know we are dealing with text, we should interpret the number 65 as "A", "B" as 66 and so on. Of course, it changed, different people had different standards and agreements but who cares, let's simplify. We come to understand the second axiom:</p>
<ol>
<li>We, as socity, have assigned certain roles/meaning to particular numbers, in this case it's letters.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have our computer, that understands numbers, and we know which numbers in which case are which letters, we kinda can start forming words for example. And if you have words you can have sentences, code, whatnot. That's more useful. All of your software builds on top of this base truth.</p>
<p>Now that we know that all words in fact, are nothing but numbers for your computer, we can go further than that.</p>
<p>For the computer, a given word, regardless of the context, based on the above, holds the same 'meaning' or 'value'. So even though you can say 'dust the furniture' as in clean or 'dust on the furniture' as in there's a mess, the representation (and the meaning) for the computer would stay the same, even though there's a mess and clean are two totally different things. So, even though we can convert a word for a distinctive number for the computer so it 'knows' kind of, what's up, there's missing 'context' to judge the meaning.</p>
<ol>
<li>Words simply represented as binary numbers lack context.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, humans can be ingenious in the ways they do wicked things, but also in the ways the do great things. One such example here would be Contextualized word embeddings. What does that stand for? Well, let me tell you. </p>
<p>So we have this now simple case of turning a series of 1s and 0s into numbers, numbers into letters and then words. That you already understood, right? We kinda explained the problem with that - lack of context. Well. We have developed methods that allow us to generate different and unique numbers for words, depending on their context or semantic meaning. So if we used Contextualized Word Embeddings in our example above, the 'dust' from 'dust the furniture' would get totally different number than the word dust in 'dust on the floor'. Now the computer knows that these two have different meaning! How does that exactly work? It's a piece of work, let me tell you, but we won't cover that in this text. First of all I'd have to understand that myself haha. </p>
<p>Long story short, we have a magic function that does this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>number_representation_of_a_word_and_meaning</span><span>(</span><span>"dust"</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>=</span><span>"dust on the floor"</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>42</span>
<span>number_representation_of_a_word_and_meaning</span><span>(</span><span>"dust"</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>=</span><span>"dust the floor"</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>24</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The values are not random - words that within certain context have different meaning probably will have very different number assigned to them. A number that is far apart from the other one. If the meanings were similar, but just slightly different depending on the context, we'd have numbers that are closer to each other.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>number_representation_of_a_word_and_meaning</span><span>(</span><span>"bark"</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>=</span><span>"bark is a noun"</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>12</span>
<span>number_representation_of_a_word_and_meaning</span><span>(</span><span>"bark"</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>=</span><span>"bark is a verb"</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>19</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Why is that? "Bark" and "bark" both relate to something that is assosciated with outer protection or covering. If a dog barks usually it is a sign of danger, something related to safety, protection. The tree has a bark in order to protect itself from the environment. It's different, still, but this time we share a certain common theme at least in some sense, hence the numbers we got are closer together than in the previous case, because they are more similar.</p>
<p>Also</p>
<ol>
<li>Similar meaning of words, in a particular context, converted to numbers, are closer to each other than radically different meanings.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the way, what are embeddings you might wonder? Why did I not describe it earlier? Because we need to understand the above to understand embeddings. More or less it's what we described, so the way of representing a number based on particular set of criteria (in our case the semantic meaning) as similar numbers, even if they are not similar raw value wise. So in the embeddings world, 'dust' would be, as a number, closer to 'clean' than 'dust' would be to 'dirt'. At least that's how I understand it. And 'dust' as in 'dust the floor' would be far away from both 'dust on the floor' or 'dirt'.</p>
<p>Alright, this one was a bit trickier, but we got there eventually. </p>
<p>Again, let me reiterate. We have electrons and then electricity. Because of electricity (or to be more exact high/low current) we have 1s and 0s, so binary language. Next are numbers, binary numbers, so just numbers but expressed only with 1s and 0s, base 2. That gets converted to base 10, so the decimal system that we humans mostly use (not everywhere and not always lol). These numbers then get simply mapped to words with the same values regardless of the context, of the meaning, in the base case.</p>
<p>But nowadays, we iterated over that and can assosciate words with their meaning and assign different numbers, based on the context of the text or a sentence (sentence transformers sounds familiar?) and their semantic meaning. The groundbreaking publication about Transformer model. Go look it up. By the way look at the year it was published and how quickly we went from theoreticall stuff to something as amazing as GPT-4. INSANE. Either way. Semantic meaning, embeddings and transformer model. This is the reason that the LLMs or generative AI can sound so convincing, as if it really knew the stuff it generated. Nope, it doesn't. It just processes numbers, they do not intrinsically understand the meaning, they understand that 1 is closer to 2 than 24 is to 42, which is the answer to everything. See what I did there? This does not imply it 'understands' the meaning in the human sense and why I'm quite sure that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), so something that 'really' thinks in the most human way, is so far away. The current technology and models, simply do not work like we assume them to.</p>
<p>Okay champ. We have these words mapped to different numbers, which are either closer or further away, depending on the semantic meaning in a particular context. What now?</p>
<p>Well, math magic comes in. I ain't no maths guy, I do enjoy the thought exercises or elementary and truthfully representation of stuff it can provide, nowadays I'd struggle to solve quadratic equation probably, being just a simple highschool dropout, but let me share with you my understanding of this absolutely marevelous phenomenon that happens.</p>
<p>So, numbers. In maths we have this thing called Algebra. It's a study of relationships between things that vary over time, which are represented by symbols, usually letters, which also can represent things, usually numbers. What? ... Yeah. That would be my reaction to this statement too, at least was in the past. Let's make it a bit more digestible. To put it in simple terms, for us numbers are things that allow us to measure reality, count things, they are building blocks of reality you could say. Almost everything (or as some would argue - everything), given a proper formula, could be represented as a number. Be it something so physical as the length of your arm, number of apples in your kitchen or something as abstract as human language or even the meaning of a word, which we have demonstrated above. That however relates to this particular branch of mathemathics and 'real' stuff. In here numbers are immanent, simple, natural, the best. What about branches of maths that operate on a bit different set of rules and so on? Different universes of sorts? Well, in there numbers might not be the best base unit of operation, in different universes we might need either different base building blocks or we might want to take numbers and extend them a bit, if you will, to make life easier. </p>
<p>One such example is the study of Linear Algebra. Linear Algebra has 'vectors' (which in fact are numbers with certain additional stuff to abstract ideas and make life easier) the same way basic Algebra has numbers/symbols/variables. I won't go into the details here too much as my understanding is also not so perfect, and probably I'd spout some gibberish, but I hope you get the analogy.</p>
<p>So in Linear Algebra we have vector spaces, which deal with vectors, that have something to do with 'space' in general. Space might sound familiar because we talked about it. Remember the 'distance' between the numbers which were representations of meaning of a given word in a particular context? Yep, the same stuff let's say. </p>
<p>Space can have many 'dimensions', similarly with vectors. If you have one dimension, it's just [1]. If we have two, e.g. X &amp; Y axis, we can position a point in place by having, well, two numbers for each dimension, eg [1,1], this should ring a bell if you remember anything from your middleschool math class.
What if we have 3D space? Well, similar stuff. Notice how each additional dimension multiplies the number of all the possible vectors. So let's assume we are working on a limited range of natural numbers, 10. In 1D case, we have 10 options. In 2D space we have 10 possibilities for first one, 10 for the second one, which totals to 10 * 10 = 100 possible different combinations. In case of 3d? You get the idea.</p>
<p>So now imagine how insanely big the possibilities are, if we are working with a bit of a broader range (e.g. 65536 or 256) and not with 3 dimensions, but with 1536! That's INSANE. Absolutely insane, but also what allows our LLMs to seemingly perceive so many nuances in the meanings of the words and what nots. </p>
<p>I know it was a long digression, but bear with me. Again. We have electrons and then electricity. Yeah, I'll spare you that repetition again. Number representation of a word based on semantic meaning. So we have a number per meaning in a given context let's say. This number gets then turned into a vector which lives inside vector space. To accomodate for the many meanings and contexts and how contextual our actions, words and speech are, this vector space should have appropriate number of dimensions. It can't have too much as it'd get too huge to process. OpenAI settled for 1536 dimensions. Remember each 'dimension' can be assigned a different 'value', so the total number of possible meanings is THE_MAX_NUMBER_WE_OPERATE_ON to the power of 1536. THAT"S A LOT. Anyhow.</p>
<p>We went from having 1s and 0s, to our words being evaluated in 1536 dimensions or 'meanings'. The more true to a particular meaning is that word, the higher the value it'll get in that dimension.</p>
<p>As you can see we have a problem now. How do we actually process such a humongous amount of data? Traditional methods don't really work well or would be too expensive computationally or economically. This is what we call "curse of dimensionality". To deal with this stuff like Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search problem show up. Meaning: how do we find similar vectors (numbers) in very high dimensional spaces? </p>
<p>To resolve that puzzle we came up with Hierarchical Navigable Small World or HNSW. What is that? Long story short, even though the space is so HUGE, usually, in large networks, eg. human ones or social ones, despite the size, most nodes can be reached from any place in the network with surprisingly few steps. It's often reffered to as "six phones rule", that states that you are at maximum six phone call aways from anyone in the world. You know someone who knows someone and so on, then boom. Your message gets delivered to Obama. It's quite interesting actually. Important to note is that not all nodes in the network are connected equally. There are these things called as hyperconnectors, which connect to A LOT of nodes, and the contrary so, the nodes that are a bit lonely. I think you get the idea and seen an example in your life - almost everybody knows that someone who seems to know everybody everywhere. Either way, as I digress. If we take this Small World thing and add one more thing on top of it - hierarchy, managing even such a huge amount of data becomes doable. What does it look like? Simple. Think in terms of enterprise org chart. It's as if, let's say, you were a CEO and wanted to know something about if your company does use type hinting in python like human beings do. In HNSW the approach would be to first select a candidate, who might know something (be similar to the topic/value you search for) from a very few selected people in the company (mby the hyperconnectors should be at the top? ;)). Let's say the are Lead/Director level people. So you e.g. have Director of PeopleOPs, Director of Product, Director of Engineering and so on. Out of these, the semantic value of Director of Engineering will be most similar to "do we use type hinting in python". So we go to him and there we repeat the process. However our guys here are lazy for whatever reason. he doesn't want to check or write the answer, so he delegates. -&gt; who does the director know, who in the hierarchy is the level below him (these are the guys he knows best, he doesn't know the ones lower too well as he doesn't interact with them often) that should know the answer? So he repeats the process: Engineering Manager in Frontend team, EM in DevOps, EM in Backend team. Backend Team it is.</p>
<p>Now this process gets repeted till we hit the bottom most layer of hierarchy, how many there are is up to the organisation to decide.</p>
<p>This way instead of the CEO asking maximum number of N people in the worst case, assuming that only the last person knew, the question gets asked only N maximum number of times, where N is the number of layers in the hierarchy we have. Or something like that.</p>
<p>Of course if he asked the question to everyone he would have better data and could select the best answer. The one he will get in the case of using HNSW will be good enough (how good we want will require us to define a certain metric, but the more accurate the answer needs to be, the tricker it is computationally) but will cost SIGNIFICANTLY less to get. Think sth like rolling out a feature that covers 80% of the needs in 2 weeks vs perfecting it to 99.99% in 2 years. 80% (or 50 or 95) is usually good enough when you weight the pros and cons, cost/benefit.</p>
<p>WOAH. Long story long, this is what enables us to process such huge amounts of data taht is so high in dimensionality, that can accomodate the various context, nuances and meanings that is assosciated with for example human speech or thinking process.</p>
<p>Now imagine our brains do this at a higher and more profund level than this, they do it constantly, all the time, they fit into something small like our skull and run on the equivalent of 24 Watts of power per hour. In comparison GPT-4 hardware requires SWATHES of data-centre space and an estimated 7.5 MW per hour. So around <strong>312 500x</strong> less while doing stuff that is thousand times more sophisticated. WHAT THE FLYING FK. We are a wonder of Nature. An amazing, fu**ing mess of a wonder but a wonder nonetheless. Also, keep in mind that our brains don't dedicate 100% of the horsepower to conscious thinking processes. According to Auburn Unviersity paper I found, cognitive neuroscientists believe that only 5% of our cognitive activity is conscious. So multiply this number by anything from 20 to a 100. Let's be conservative and say 10 for some reason. That's still over 3 million times the efficiency than GPT-4, while also having at least a magnitude (or at least N) greater complexity. I got carried away in the amazement. </p>
<p>TLDR:
Electrons -&gt; Electricity -&gt; Binary -&gt; Binary Numbers -&gt; "Human" or base 10 numbers -&gt; Letters -&gt; Words -&gt; Embeddings -&gt; (Semantically) Contextual Word Embeddings -&gt; Vectors -&gt; Vector Spaces -&gt; High Dimension Vector Spaces -&gt; Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search or just Nearest Neighbour Search (ANNS/NNS) -&gt; Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)</p>
<p>Soak up all these terms and write them down.</p>
<p>From here we are almost done. If you've been following closely you might start to piece the puzzles together.</p>
<p>LLMs are in fact just algorithms, very complex ones, that have indexed or ingested A LOT of data/words, vectorized and embedded them and their meanings in particular context. Then, based on that data, they just 'guess', based on context, that if we have this particular thing or meaning in a semantic context, so embeddings, so nubmers or vectors in high dimensional space, just right here, we probably have in mind this particular response which is nothing but a set of other embeddings. </p>
<p>Also usually when we speak about embeddings, we deal with tokens, which usually are not whole words but like ~4 characters in English. </p>
<p>So if based on the context and approximation, we know that this particular query seems like something that will be assosciated with this particular token, we will use it. Then if we have one token ahead, we can repeat the process till we start hitting lower levels of assosciation, which in turn means that we can probably stop generating as the answer is complete.</p>
<p>So... Yup. There's no thinking happening. Just assosciating numbers and guessing. You read that right. GPT-4 does not 'think' at all. It's as far away from human consciousness as we are from Putin being a good guy. This simply does not come even close. So it's the reason I do not worry at night (at least yet) AGI will come and replace me or go on a consciouss crusade against humanity.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, my understanding of the stuff is VERY limited, I'm all new to this. I've simplified A LOT not only for the reader, but also for myself. If any of this is unjustly inaccurate, let me know. I've googled most of the stuff along the way. </p>
<p>WHOAH. DAMN THAT WAS LONG. </p>
<p>Let's answer the initial question then. How do vector databases work then? Well, they take the text. Vectorize it. Embedd in high-dimension space, then if you query it, they search for approximate similar tokens/pieces/texts. Simple, right?</p>
<p>Now with that over, let's get to the stuff I had in mind when starting the article, so comparison of vector databases and a raport from using some of the more popular ones.</p>
<h2>Starting point - chromaDB</h2>
<p>My starting point was <a href="https://www.trychroma.com/">chromaDB</a>. It allowed me get up &amp; running quickly and seamlessly. It was dead simple and it got the job done. However it wasn't the best approach TBH. For a PoC? Yup, it did get the job done. But for more serious, potentially production-grade stuff? Not given how I implemented it. </p>
<p>Long story short, for a PoC, I created this Q&amp;A over a scraped knowledge centre app let's say. I needed a VectorDB deseprately. Pinecone was off-record for obious reasons that I'll list later on in the article, even though it was the easiest to implement I'd say. There was stuff like FAISS and what not, but the choice, over initial exploration, fell on chromaDB. </p>
<p>I used a very dirty approach, where I packaged it together in one container with the API backend part of the application. ChromaDB persisted the vectors in their internal format in a certain directory in my project's repo. I simply commited it to the repo. Not the best, I know. </p>
<p>Now, the whole VDB (Vector Database) was a part of our repo. I locally ingested the data that I needed in the VDB, then commited the state of the VDB to the repo.</p>
<p>chromadb got added as a project dependency (installing it is quite trivial - it's just a python package) to pyproject.toml and boom. Initialise it somewhere in the code during application startup and boom, you done. Again, this is very dirty approach. </p>
<p>API is packaged in the same container as the DB. In this setup changes in the VDB are not really persisted unless you commit them to the repo - only the commited state matters (so read-only apps or go home champ). They share resources. If one fails, the other does too. It was somehow scalable given that we had read-only app, so it was self-contained but... </p>
<p>The git repo got big, fast. The docker image build time got very long for my standards. I mean imagine 25-30m build time for a simple fastAPI app. Not exactly desirable. This came from the fact that the chromadb was inside the container and had to be rebuilt each time the code changed, and as you can imagine, rebuilding db package can be quite time consuming (looking at you, psycopg).</p>
<p>We couldn't go on for long with this approach. Ofc you can run chromadb as a separate container, self-hosted, but that added overhead I didn't need at that time for a PoC. At that time, from what I remember, there was also no option to do proper clustering that'd allow you to get prod-level scalability, survavibality and so on. TLDR: you could run with a single instance and that's it. I also didn't see helm/k8s OOB support that'd make it easy to deploy in a cluster somewhere. On top of that other projects were in the pipeline, then what? Each of them should have their own instance? How would we share data? All of this meant, it had to go away.</p>
<p>But it allowed me to get off the ground, integrate fast, LEARN a lot and so on. For this purpose it did an AMAZING job.</p>
<p>Also, what needs to be said is <strong>that some of the features mentioned weren't supported at the time</strong> I was creating the project, which was <strong>couple of months ago</strong>. Since then <strong>Chroma has closed $18M seed round,</strong> developed a solid roadmap and started addressing some of what was mentioned here. We had a nice talk with Jeff Huber, chromadb's Founder, about all of this. I really loved a lot how he was humble and helpful enough to admit, that <strong>given the preconditions for the project &amp; productionisation</strong>, chroma <strong>at that time</strong> wasn't exactly the best choice, and choosing something else for our needs was a smart move! He is a <strong>very intelligent, passionate and brilliant guy,</strong> so I'm more than eager to see how they develop, <strong>however till we see the features shipped</strong>, in the use cases we had in mind, it was a no-go. However to get started, have one-self-contained app with db inside and be done in 4h instead of 4 days (I know i exaggurate)? Sure, why not. If I was to make a comparison to something people are more familiar with,RDMBSes, I'd say the current chroma is like sqlite. Easier to comprehend now where it can shine and where it won't? Great. Also remember, my approach was simple. If you do it properly, set up all the proper stuff, configure it nicely, adhere to best practices, you probably won't run into any problems. I did not do that, lack of time &amp; expertise.</p>
<p>A short edit here needed to happen. I've reviewed this together with Jeff (THANKS) and he shed light on how most of these issues got addresed in v0.4. </p>
<p>They made an architectural shift in their design, changed the storage engine, the build is now at least 20x faster (which now makes my point invalid), requires way less memory (that was not an issue though, but is good to see) and is far more performand and durable (even in April I did not run into any issues with durability). Overall, as I've predicted before actually getting the message from Jeff, it's been a short time, yet they've made amazing progress. This made me reshuffle the recomendations part a bit and this + the coming changes, make chroma a strong candidate to evaluate. I still need to play around with it more to see the exact progress but seems promising.</p>
<p>So now, most of the stuff that I mentioned in this section, that were relevant at the time of making the choice - April, are not a concern now. Keep this in mind.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>So if chromaDB was out of the picture. What next? Let's see what's out there.</p>
<p>Let's start with stuff that failed fairly quickly.</p>
<h3>Pinecone</h3>
<p>Long story short. It's a black box hosted somewhere, VDB as a Service. Proprietary. No-go. I want control over my data, where my db is deployed, where it lives and so on. Sorry. Privacy &amp; Compliance would not be happy, same with myself.</p>
<h3>Faiss</h3>
<p>It's just a library. not a full fledged VDB. It'd be a step back compared to chroma, so no. But for tiny PoCs? Possible. Evalute it. I didn't do that in detail.</p>
<h3>Milvus</h3>
<p>This one seemed promising. Initially I thought we'd roll with them. Promised all the new shiny nice stuff, but then I actually started using it. Had troubles to even index the data. Started running into bugs (or documentation not explaining stuff dumb enough for me to get it or not explaining at all), weird edge cases and complications that I was not in for. In case of chroma I just plugged it in, ran my Langchain-based data-ingestion service and I was done. Here? Forget it. However it was farily decent and pleasant to run locally in docker, a bit less so in k8s, but still passable. Bonus points for OS, self-hosted version and on-prem + cloud possibilty. If I was to make a similar comaprison as I did in case of chromadb, I'd say Milvus is the old Oracle DB of Vector Database world. Plus I've heard some similar opinions and unconfirmed rumours regarding ceratin dubious possible origins/practices and policies. It did seem promising but ended up as a failure last minute.</p>
<p>Eventually I did succeed in ingesting the data and so on, but the results were not satisfactory. Performance was okay, but I was done with frustration.</p>
<h3>pgvector</h3>
<p>This one disappointed me greatly.</p>
<p>Bad performance. Unusual selection of the underlying algorithm. Some problems with accuracy, especially when concurrency comes into play. Think carefully if the ease of integration is worth it. In my opinion this + the performance weren't. Take a look at the benchmarks. It's not satisfactory to say the least.</p>
<p>It also turned out that it's not supported everywhere as it's relatively new extension, for postgres standards. </p>
<p>And it's me who says this, guy who is team postgres. But postgres is a great RDBMS. Again, it does not specialise in vectors. </p>
<p>The benefit here is it being a standard piece of infrastructure, having your data in one place, all the other benefits postgres brings. It's still useful piece of software.</p>
<p>Bear in mind though, that in AWS world, aurora does not support it yet. Meaning if you are in aurora world, you'll need to deploy a separate base postgres instance with pgvector enabled. This eliminates the main benefit.</p>
<p>However if you do not care about that, you are running your own pgvector instance, and just want to get started? Hm, maybe. So there might be some relevant and valid use cases, but not in my case.</p>
<p>The performance was not there, accuracy also, especially when concurrency is considered and throughput. We couldn't deploy it in our Aurora cluster, we'd need to go for separate RDS. I think I'll pass, however it was indeed tempting because of the postgres brand, it being so reliable and common, but let's consider the borader picture - this was 2nd iteration where I expected things to be done in a proper, future-proof manner.</p>
<p>For RDBMS just go postgres. For VDB? Think twice about using pgvector.</p>
<h3>Redis</h3>
<p>Redis was a strong possible candidate. Good performance. Standard piece of infrastructure. Everyone knows redis, right? Features on the thin side though. I wasn't sure if, given some time, it'd be enough. But I kept it in place. It more or less worked. However It lingered in my mind that Redis is not specialised in Vectors. It's key value store. This is not the core of their business. Sure it'd be nice to be able to just deploy redis and have it done with. Everyone knows redis. However doubts sprouted in my mind, rightfully so eg. given their recent sunsetting of Redis Graph. </p>
<p>However if you already have a Redis cluster running somewhere, for starting it might be enough. </p>
<p>There is the question of perfromance, sure, but it's acceptable.</p>
<p>So, yeah, viable choice, but make a conscious decision.</p>
<h3>Qdrant</h3>
<p>Open source? Check. Self-hosted option? Check. Cloud if you are lazy? Check. K8s? Check. Clustering? Check. Survavibality? Check. Performance? Off the charts. Community? Great. Integration with langchain and other libs? Yup. One-line docker and you good to go locally? You bet. I was sold. </p>
<p>But then it got better. Within hours of signing up for their cloud offering to test things out I was approached by the founders to check in. Big shotout to @Andre Zayarni, @Fabrizio Schmidt and @Andrey Vasnetsov. Keep doing what you doing. We had a meeting set up right after. Tremendous knowledge. I really like the spirit they operate in or the values they highlight in some of their blog articles, especially the one related to closing the seed round. Andre's writing is sharp AF. Snarky remarks about the article not being written by chatGPT get bonus points (btw gonna steal that one).</p>
<p>They offered help (despite me not earning them a dime at that moment and stating that it'd be the case for the coming future or it'll be dime a dollar) with everything. Accommodated to our needs. Shared slack channel if problems arise? There you go. You wanna learn more? Sure, here are the resources. Workshops? Possible.</p>
<p>Also, big shotout to @Kacper Łukawski, which is just in love with spreading knowledge and helping out people. He provided lots of insights and offered help to get started out. Real beneficial stuff. Tutorials, blog posts, integrations with most popular libraries.</p>
<p>Free tier in the cloud offering to test stuff out (that actually can take you far along?) provided to anyone. </p>
<p>Qdrant wins by far, in my experience, when it comes to performance, scalability, durability, ease of use, feature set, flexibility and most importantly community plus the company values.</p>
<p>On top of that you can get started in minutes. It was best performance, easiest to use &amp; set up, well documented, nice community. Clear win.</p>
<p>As you can see I'm totally biased and sold, so take what I wrote with a grain of salt and verify yourself all of the above. I'll however remain quite bullish </p>
<h3>Weaviate</h3>
<p>Heard some good stuff here, especially regarding the feature set. However did not try it out personally. Compared to qdrant tho, they do have to improve on performance probably, but it might be a valid potential choice. Plus their community seems nice. Or I'm being biased only because @Philip Vollet, so their head of Dev Growth laughed at my joke about pgvector, so he seems salty in similar way to myself, which implicates good stuff. Eh, Olaf and his shenanigans again. Either way. Check it out, should be ok.</p>
<h2>Tie it all together</h2>
<p>So now, we understand some basic concepts regarding the vectors, embeddings, fundaments of CS, HNSW, ANNS. What Vector Databases do, is to tie this all together, provide more functionalities on top of that and some abstraction layer, so you don't have to reinvent the while, and on top of that, they also take care about the regular stuff that databases do.</p>
<p>What are they? Well, it's mostly stuff related to scalability (so you can easily handle millions of users), persistence (so stuff doesn't get lost), survivability (so it doesn't randomly die easily), data consistency and so on. </p>
<p>It's A LOT of work to do. We don't want to take care about all of these ourselves, do we?</p>
<p>So that's why we let Vector Databases take care of that. It's something they should excell at, other than performance and accuracy, obviously. It's not easy at all.</p>
<p>Also, I think that before you call your product a Database, it's required it meets at least some of these conditions as lately, in the hype driven world, it's not always the case.</p>
<p>Given that, all of the above and certain set of requirements I had for the project, I did the evaluation and research as to which product to actually choose.</p>
<p>Below you'll find a very brief and to the point summary of it. I didn't want to dig deep into the tech details to keep this article digestible, so these will come eventually in another article.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ol>
<li>Qdrant rocks and wins. In all categories. It's postgres of the VDB world.</li>
<li>Weaviate seems to be nice too, but don't quote me on that. Features seem nice and rich for LLMs.</li>
<li>Pinecone gets you started in minutes, but so does qdrant and why would you lock yourself in their ecosystem? Plus the performance and price, but might be valid choice for some folks just coz of the Managed mindset and convenience.</li>
<li>Chromadb lacks certain features, but develops quickly, however it needs evaluation and observation for bigger projects or situations where we need real clusters. For smaller ones with proper setup I'd say it's a valid choice + look out for their development and upcoming features. A bit like sqlite of the VDB world, but on steroids currently.</li>
<li>Redis is acceptable, but doesn't shine IMO. Positive surprise performance wise. It's not core of their business tho, plus they seem to be sunsetting certain parts that do not belong to the core like RedisGraph.</li>
<li>pgvector is disappointing, but still can be valid in some use cases and scenarios, it levarage the postgres brand and benefits which also enforce certain limitations on it. Do not count on great performance though or accuracy with concurrency.</li>
<li>Milvus is what I'd stay away from. Old Oracle of VDB world.</li>
<li>For anything that can hit production, FAISS is a no-go, it's just a lib. For simple play-around hobby projects? Why not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, this was written by a human in a 4h long flow state powered act of uninterrupted creativity. It was fun, I've actually learned a lot.
I've written this in one go almost, except minor stuff or including the feedback from Jeff. I'll leave it mostly unedited, with original wording and typos.</p>

<p><em>tl;dr: After having explained how to read box plots to thousands of workshop participants, I now believe that they’re poorly conceived (box plots, not workshop participants 😉 ), which makes this classic chart type unnecessarily unintuitive, hard to grasp, and prone to misinterpretation. This has caused innumerable distribution-based insights to fail to land with audiences who weren’t willing or able to grasp them. Alternative chart types are virtually always easier to learn how to read, more informative, or both. </em></p>



<hr>



<p>Not sure what a box plot (a.k.a., a “box-and-whisker plot”) is or how to read one? If so, you should watch <a href="https://youtu.be/iBq23-eQhp8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this explanatory video</a> before continuing.</p>



<p>I used to use box plots often, but I rarely use them now. In fact, virtually never. Why not? Well, if you watched the explanatory video linked above, you saw that it took me over <em>four</em> <em>minutes</em> to explain how to read a box plot. If a chart type requires that much time to explain, it had better deliver a huge “epiphany payoff,” as data storytelling expert <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brentdykes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brent Dykes</a> calls it, i.e., it had better deliver valuable insights that can’t be communicated using simpler, more familiar chart types that require less time and effort for the audience to understand.</p>



<p>In my experience, though, virtually all the types of insights that chart creators try to communicate using box plots can be communicated using simpler, more familiar, and, frankly, better-designed chart types that don’t require audiences to slog through a multi-minute comprehension process beforehand.</p>



<h2>“I have no idea what you’re talking about. I can read box plots just fine and so can the audiences for my charts.”</h2>



<p>Let me share a few observations from my experiences explaining how to read box plots to thousands of workshop participants over the years:</p>



<ul><li>Most people don’t know how to read box plots. Among participants in my workshops—who generally have above-average <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199599868.001.0001/acref-9780199599868-e-760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graphicacy</a> levels to begin with—typically less than 20 percent already know how to read box plots.</li><li>People struggle to grasp box plots much more than other “fundamental” chart types, and more even than “complex” chart types like scatterplots or histograms.</li><li>Even when audiences are familiar with box plots, they still require excessive, unnecessary cognitive gymnastics to interpret compared with alternative chart types such as strip plots and distribution heatmaps (see examples below), and are prone to misinterpretation.</li></ul>



<p>These issues arise from what I see as flaws in the traditional box plot design, which was first proposed by Mary Spear in 1952 and refined by dataviz legend John Tukey in 1969 (I can feel the flames licking at my heels already). What, exactly, are those flaws? I see three significant ones, which I’ll examine in detail:</p>



<ol><li>The design of traditional box plots doesn’t make ‘visual sense,’ which makes them unnecessarily hard to learn how to read and prone to misinterpretation.</li><li>Box plots require audiences to grasp complex concepts that they don’t need to understand in most cases.</li><li>Box plots conceal information that’s usually crucial to see.</li></ol>



<p>Let’s have a closer look at each of these problems in turn:</p>



<h2>The design of traditional box plots doesn’t make ‘visual sense.’</h2>



<p>Box plots are needlessly hard to grasp because their visual design doesn’t align well with how the human visual system works, i.e., they don’t make ‘visual sense.’ Specifically, I see three problems with the visual design of traditional box plots:</p>



<ol><li>If you’re a human with normal vision, you intuitively perceive thick, wide shapes as representing greater quantities (of whatever) than thin, narrow shapes. The ‘box’ segments in each box-and-whisker shape, then, look like they represent <em>more of something</em> than the ‘whisker’ segments, leading to the faulty interpretation that they contain more values, or perhaps have more importance. All four box and whisker segments contain the <em>same</em> number of values, however, and all four segments are equally important (unless the chart author wants to draw attention to the middle two segments for a specific reason). The concept of quartiles is hard enough for most people to grasp (more on that in a moment) and making the second and third quartiles look ‘bigger’ than the first and fourth quartiles really, really doesn’t aid comprehension. I was unsurprised to recently discover that <a href="https://www.psychologicabelgica.com/articles/10.5334/pb.az/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> has shown that this design flaw throws off even experienced box plot readers.<br></li><li>The two middle ‘box’ segments (i.e., the second and third quartiles) look like one, single shape with a dividing line in it (i.e., the median). This visually suggests that there are <em>three</em> parts in each box-and-whisker shape (a top whisker, a middle box, and a bottom whisker), not four. The middle box isn’t a single group that’s divided in two, though, it’s <em>two distinct groups</em> (i.e., two distinct quartiles). The middle two ‘box’ segments aren’t related to each other any more or less closely than, say, the top two segments, or the bottom two segments. (Yes, I know, the middle two segments are the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interquartile range</a>,’ but I don’t see a reason to <em>always</em> visually emphasize that fact.) Similarly, the two ‘whisker’ segments look like they may be more closely related in some way because, well, they’re both whiskers. But there’s no inherently special relationship between the first and fourth quartiles, either.<br></li><li>People associate longer shapes with greater quantity, which is why we find bar charts and other chart types that are based on that principle to be intuitive. In a box plot, however, longer box or whisker segments <em>don’t</em> represent greater quantities. The four segments in a box plot each represent the <em>same</em> quantity, i.e., they each contain the same number of values, regardless of how long or short they are. In fact, shorter segments in box plots actually represent <em>higher densities</em> of values, so there’s a “mismatch” between what our eyes are telling us and the underlying data. This is why, to many people, the box plot in the example below doesn’t <em>look</em> like it’s showing the same data as the histogram beside it, even though it is.</li></ol>

<p><meta charset="utf-8">Yes, I know. Shorter segments in a box plot <em>do</em> represent less quantity because the ‘quantity’ in a box plot is the range spanned by each quartile. That requires a big, counter-intuitive (and unnecessary) leap for most audiences, though.</p>



<p>Design concepts such as the ones below make more ‘visual sense’ than box plots:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=720%2C306&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="720" height="306" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=1024%2C435&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=300%2C127&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=768%2C326&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=1536%2C653&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=500%2C212&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=800%2C340&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=1280%2C544&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=450%2C191&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=1360%2C578&amp;ssl=1 1360w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=250%2C106&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=550%2C234&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=424%2C180&amp;ssl=1 424w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=706%2C300&amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?resize=1177%2C500&amp;ssl=1 1177w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?w=1833&amp;ssl=1 1833w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alternative-quartile-concepts.png?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>While these alternative designs would still require a certain amount of explanation, they’d probably be easier to grasp than box plots:</p>



<ul><li>They make it clearer that shorter segments contain higher concentrations of values.</li><li>They don’t draw unwarranted attention to the middle two segments.</li><li>They look like four shapes instead of three.</li></ul>



<p>If you find these design concepts to be less intuitive than box plots, ask yourself if that’s because they’re <em>actually</em> less intuitive, or if it’s because you’ve just gotten used to reading box plots over time.</p>



<p>Despite making more visual sense than box plots, I <em>still</em> wouldn’t recommend these design concepts <em>or</em> box plots in most situations because…</p>



<h2>For most types of insights, audiences don’t need to understand complex, abstract concepts like quartiles.</h2>



<p>Box plots require audiences to understand the concept of dividing a sorted set of values into ranges such that an equal number of values fall within each range, resulting in ranges of different sizes, i.e., the concept of <em>quantiles</em> and, specifically, <em>quartiles</em>. Yes, many people who are likely to read this article will be familiar with these concepts, but most audiences are not. Most audiences require multi-minute explanations to grasp them (ideally, with visual aids and examples, as in the explanatory video linked at the beginning of this article), and audiences need to grasp those concepts <em>fully</em> before they can even begin to interpret a box plot correctly. As we’ll see in a moment, though, there are other chart types that can be used to communicate a wide variety of useful, distribution-based insights, <strong>but</strong> <strong>that</strong> <strong><em>don’t</em></strong><strong> require audiences to understand quantiles, quartiles, or any other abstract, complex concepts.</strong></p>



<h2>“But <em>I</em> don’t find box plots hard to understand.”</h2>



<p>I hear you. <em>I</em> don’t find them hard to understand, either. That’s because you and I have been looking at box plots for years and our brains have learned to “think around” their design flaws. It <em>doesn’t</em> mean that they’re a well-designed chart type. People encountering box plots for the first time <em>do</em> get tripped up by these design flaws and, while you might have forgotten it, you almost certainly got tripped up by them the first time that you encountered a box plot, as well.</p>



<p>And the design problems with box plots continue to cause needless grief in organizations, when well-meaning analysts try to use them to communicate important insights to decision makers, but then get shot down because the decision makers aren’t willing to figure out how to read them. After experiencing these negative outcomes, analysts often assume that decision-makers don’t “get” distribution charts of <em>any</em> kind, which is unfortunate because visualizing distributions can yield invaluable insights. Analysts often just give up, though, because they don’t realize that the problem<em> </em>isn’t that their audience doesn’t grasp distribution charts <em>in general</em>, it’s that they don’t grasp box plots <em>in particular</em>. Using more intuitive distribution chart types (see below) would almost certainly yield more positive outcomes.</p>



<p>Regardless of how comfortable you are reading box plots, though, there’s also the minor detail that …&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Box plots often misrepresent distributions.</h2>



<p>Have a look at the box plot on the left, then compare it to the jittered strip plot <em>of the same data</em> on the right:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box plot on the left makes the distribution of ages of study participants in the “Test group” look almost identical to that of the “Control group”. As we can see in the jittered strip plot on the right, though, the two groups are quite different (which might substantially impact the results of our study). I’m <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316652618_Same_Stats_Different_Graphs_Generating_Datasets_with_Varied_Appearance_and_Identical_Statistics_through_Simulated_Annealing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not the first</a> to point out that box plots <em>always</em> make distributions look ‘bell shaped,’ i.e., like the values are clustered around the median and gradually trail off away from the median. If a set of values <em>isn’t</em> bell shaped (like the “Control group” above), though, box plots <em>make them look bell shaped anyway</em>.</p>



<p>This is almost always a real problem because, even if all the sets of values in a box plot <em>do</em> have bell-shaped distributions, readers can’t <em>know</em> that, and so, at best, they’ll be left wondering if all distributions are actually bell shaped or not. There are other important limitations of box plots, such as hiding gaps in distributions and concealing the number of values in each group, but let’s leave it at that for now because this article is already pretty long.</p>



<p>Dataviz experts have proposed modifications to box plots and more sophisticated chart types that represent distributions more accurately to mitigate this misrepresentation issue. I want to clarify, though, that the main point that I want to make in this article <em>isn’t</em> that box plots can misrepresent distributions (although that is an issue), it’s that box plots are <em>needlessly</em> <em>hard to</em> <em>learn how to read in the first place</em>. More sophisticated chart types don’t help with that problem since they can be even <em>harder</em> for audiences to learn how to read. In any event, more sophisticated chart types aren’t needed for most day-to-day decision-making in most organizations, which can be fully supported by simpler distribution chart types, speaking of which…</p>



<h2>“What are these more intuitive/useful distribution chart types of which you speak?”</h2>



<p>The box plot alternative that I use most often is a <em>strip plot</em>:</p>







<div><meta charset="utf-8"><p>Strip plots can be grasped by most audiences in <em>a few seconds</em> and can be explained with a single sentence, such as, “Each dot is the age of a study participant.” Despite their simplicity, strip plots can communicate most of the insights for which chart creators often use box plots, such as showing whether distributions are higher or lower, concentrated or dispersed, normal or skewed, have outliers, etc. They can even communicate important types of insights that box plots <em>can’t</em> show, such as gaps in distributions, multimodal (“clumpy”) distributions, or insights that require seeing roughly how many values are in each set.</p><p>If there are more than a few dozen dots/values, though, strip plots tend to turn into solid lines of overlapping dots. In those cases, a <em>jittered strip plot</em> can be a good choice since it can accommodate more dots/values, but has all the same advantages of a regular strip plot:</p></div>

<p>If there are hundreds (or millions) of values, though, jittered strip plots can also turn into solid blocks of overlapping dots, in which case you could move to what I call a <em>distribution heatmap</em>, which can handle any number of values:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=512%2C338&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="512" height="338" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=1024%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=768%2C506&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=800%2C527&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=1280%2C844&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=450%2C297&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=1214%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1214w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=550%2C362&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=273%2C180&amp;ssl=1 273w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=455%2C300&amp;ssl=1 455w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?resize=759%2C500&amp;ssl=1 759w, https://i0.wp.com/nightingaledvs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/distribution-heatmap.png?w=1308&amp;ssl=1 1308w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Yes, a distribution heatmap ups the complexity a bit since it introduces the concept of <em>bins</em> (a.k.a. <em>intervals</em>), but bins are still considerably easier to grasp than quartiles. You also lose the ability to see how many values are in each group and there are a few other limitations, but box plots have all those same limitations (plus several others).</p>



<p>These alternatives to box plots can be used to communicate a wide variety of useful insights, don’t require the audience to understand complex concepts like quartiles, and show distribution shapes clearly (i.e., they don’t make everything look bell shaped). More to the point, they make more <em>visual sense</em> than box plots, so audiences grasp them in seconds instead of minutes, and they’re less prone to misinterpretation. <strong>Ultimately, this means that using these chart types instead of box plots substantially improves the odds that your audience will understand and act on your distribution-based insights.</strong></p>



<p>There are other distribution chart types that can be useful in specific situations, such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/frequency-polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frequency polygons</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">violin plots</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/density-curves-normal-distribution-ap/percentiles-cumulative-relative-frequency/v/analyzing-a-cumulative-relative-frequency-graph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cumulative distribution plots</a>, and <a href="https://www.rhoworld.com/i-swarm-you-swarm-we-all-swarm-for-beeswarm-plots-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bee swarm plots</a>, but the three types that I described above are the easiest ones to grasp, and are able to communicate most of the insights that are needed for day-to-day decision-making in most organizations. (I’m not mentioning histograms here because they’re generally only useful for visualizing a <em>single</em> set of values, whereas box plots and their alternatives are for visualizing <em>multiple</em> sets of values, which is a different use case.)</p>



<h2>“Do box plots have any actual <em>strengths</em> compared with alternative chart types? Are there <em>any</em> situations in which a box plot would be the best choice?”</h2>



<p>Well, as far as I can tell, the only advantage of box plots is that they show quartile ranges. The obvious next question, of course, is how often it’s necessary to show quartile ranges in order to say what you need to say about the data. In my experience, it’s not nearly as often as a lot of chart creators seem to think. Most of the time, you’re pointing out that distributions are higher or lower than one another, more concentrated or more dispersed than one another, have outliers, etc. <em>None</em> of these types of insights require showing quartile ranges and all can be communicated using simpler chart types. Some types of insights might require showing <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/median.html"><em>medians</em></a>, but those can be easily added to simpler chart types:</p>

<p>So, no, I can’t think of any situations when a box plot would be the truly best choice, other than those in which the audience demands box plots because that’s what they’re used to seeing. If you can think of any such situations, though, please let me know on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickdesbarats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/nickdesb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>.</p>



<h2>“Why are box plots so ubiquitous in certain fields, then, especially in research?”</h2>



<p>Honestly, I’m not sure. Before the advent of PCs, box plots were easier to create (i.e., draw by hand) than other distribution chart types, so perhaps that’s why they caught on initially, and now that’s just what researchers are used to seeing? Let me know if you have any insight, though.</p>



<h2>“What now?”</h2>



<p>Some reviewers of an early draft of this article suggested that the conclusion should be that box plots were a good chart type in the past, but technology has advanced and now allows better chart types to be created easily, making box plots “obsolete.” I’m going a step further, though. I don’t think box plots were <em>ever </em>a well-designed chart type (although, of course, I say this with the benefit of modern research findings that the original designers didn’t have access to). Their design flaws have forced millions of hapless students, executives and others to slog through an unnecessarily cumbersome comprehension process, which could have been avoided if box plots had been better designed in the first place or if other distribution chart types had become more popular than box plots. Moving away from box plots today, then, would spare tomorrow’s chart readers that unnecessary cognitive slog.</p>



<p>Other reviewers suggested that the conclusion should be that box plots are a useful chart type, but only for statistically savvy audiences. Again, I’m going a step further, suggesting that even <em>those</em> audiences would be better served by other chart types in virtually all situations.</p>



<p>Do I expect that people who already use box plots will stop using them after reading this article? Probably not (inertia is a powerful thing…) Why did I write it, then? A few reasons:</p>



<ul><li>To encourage practitioners to consider alternative chart types, especially if their target audience isn’t familiar with box plots already (or, perhaps, even if they are…).</li><li>To acknowledge that, while this classic chart type has been a valuable tool in innumerable analyses during the last 70 years, it has design flaws that make it needlessly hard to grasp and prone to misinterpretation.</li><li>To find out if I’m wrong. I realize that I’m making some bold claims here, and it’s certainly possible that I’ve missed something. If you can describe a plausible scenario in which a box plot would be the truly best choice (for reasons other than “that’s what this audience is used to seeing”), please do <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickdesbarats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let me know</a>!</li></ul>

<p dir="auto">LetterDrop is a secure and efficient newsletter management service powered by Cloudflare Workers, enabling easy creation, distribution, and subscription management of newsletters.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The story</h2><a id="user-content-the-story" aria-label="Permalink: The story" href="#the-story"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I have been using <code>TinyLetter</code> to send newsletters to my subscribers, but unfortunately, Mailchimp has now shut down this free service. This isn't the first time I've faced such an issue, whenever this happens, I lose all my subscribers and have to look for a new way to send newsletters. To avoid this recurring problem, I've decided to build my own free newsletter service. It needs to be zero-cost, easy to use, and reliable so it won't get shut down. To achieve this, I'm using Cloudflare Workers to create the service, which I've named LetterDrop.</p>

<p dir="auto">The LetterDrop use the Cloudflare Email Worker to send emails. And there is a <code>ALLOWED_EMAILS</code> variable to control who can send newsletters. You can use the Cloudflare dashboard to update the variable.</p>
<p dir="auto">After that, you can publish a newsletter by sending your newsletter content to this specific email address. And the Email Worker will send the newsletter to all subscribers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You should config the Email Worker to let it can be triggered by the specific email address. Please refer to the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/setup/email-routing-addresses/" rel="nofollow">Cloudflare Email Worker</a> to know how to do it.</li>
<li>The newsletter email subject should be <code>[Newsletter-ID:&lt;&lt;the-newsletter-id&gt;&gt;]&lt;&lt;your-newsletter-title&gt;&gt;</code>, e.g. <code>[Newsletter-ID:9080f810-e0f7-43aa-bac8-8d1cb3ceeff4]BMPI Weekly Newsletter - 20240623</code>.</li>

<p dir="auto">Currently LetterDrop uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/" rel="nofollow">AWS SES</a> to send emails. You need to create an AWS account and configure SES to send emails. After that, you need to create a Cloudflare Worker as a notification service. The code is very simple, you can use the ChatGPT to generate the code.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to handle the failed emails?</h3><a id="user-content-how-to-handle-the-failed-emails" aria-label="Permalink: How to handle the failed emails?" href="#how-to-handle-the-failed-emails"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">LetterDrop uses the Cloudflare Queues to handle the failed emails. You can use the Cloudflare dashboard to monitor the failed emails and replay them in the dead-letter queue.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What is the next step?</h2><a id="user-content-what-is-the-next-step" aria-label="Permalink: What is the next step?" href="#what-is-the-next-step"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The next step is to add more features to LetterDrop.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvments
<ul>
<li> Add the unit tests.</li>
<li> Add the email template.</li>
<li> Track the email open rate.</li>
<li> Support more third-party email services like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Support the mulit-tenant feature.</li>
<li> Add the landing page.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to contribute?</h2><a id="user-content-how-to-contribute" aria-label="Permalink: How to contribute?" href="#how-to-contribute"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I used the GPT-4o model to generate the code for LetterDrop. That means the code is generated by the AI model, and I only need to provide the prompts to the model. This approach is very efficient and can save a lot of time. I've also recorded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL21oMWN6Y7PCqSwbwesD4_wmXEVSeeQ7h" rel="nofollow">video</a> to show how to create the LetterDrop project using the GPT-4o model.</p>
<p dir="auto">That also means you can easily customize the code by changing the prompts. You can find the prompts in the <a href="https://github.com/i365dev/LetterDrop/blob/main/docs/CDDR/app.md">CDDR</a> file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even I use the GPT model to generate the code, I still need to review the code and test it. So if you find any issues or have any suggestions, please feel free to create an issue or pull request. And there is no restriction on the contribution, you can contribute to any part of the project by yourself or with the help of the GPT model.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Disscussion</h2><a id="user-content-disscussion" aria-label="Permalink: Disscussion" href="#disscussion"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to create an issue or pull request. I'm happy to discuss with you. Or you can discuss it in this hacker news <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40764579" rel="nofollow">thread</a>.</p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Ruby is so associated with its most famous framework, Rails, that many people
forget how amazing this language is. I mean, I know a lot of people who says “I
don’t like Ruby” and when I ask why, they say something about Rails. Personally,
I consider Ruby one of my favorite programming languages, and the last time I
touched any Rails code was 7 years ago…</p>

<p>So, if I don’t use Rails anymore, what I do with Ruby? Well, Ruby is a very rich
and complete language, perhaps even more than its more famous relative, Python
(sadly, I can’t say the same about its ecosystem…). And one of the things that
I think that Ruby is better than Python is using it for writing shell
scripts.</p>

<p>That is, most of the cases Bash for me is enough, but if the script starts to
become complex, I switch to Ruby. Here I show the main features that might be
interesting for this case of use.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Show features of Ruby that are useful for writing shell scripts;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compare Ruby to Bash and Python;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="non-goals">Non-goals</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Replace <em>entirely</em> Bash scripts by Ruby scripts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="feature-1-calling-external-commands">Feature 1: calling external commands</h2>

<p>The first thing that you expect of language for writing shell scripts is to
call external commands. In Ruby, you do that using backticks (<code>`</code>):</p>



<p>That’s it! You don’t need <code>system</code>, <code>popen</code> or something like that, or import
a library. And if you set that to a variable, you’ll have the output of the
command:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Note: if you want to use <code>system</code> (e.g. if you want the output to be
redirected to stdout instead of a string) or <code>popen</code> (if you want to read or
write data from or to a subprocess), those are also available in Ruby!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="feature-2-status-code">Feature 2: status code</h2>

<p>This is real quick: in Ruby, the variable <code>$?</code> contains the status code of the
last executed command. So, it’s really close to Bash:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>`true`</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>$?</span> <span># 0</span>

<span>`false`</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>$?</span> <span># 1</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="feature-3-its-a-typed-language">Feature 3: it’s a typed language</h2>

<p>Ruby is not a <em>statically</em> typed language, but it has types. In fact, it is a
object-oriented language, and it follow strictly the OOP paradigm (more than
Python, in some aspects even more than Java!). Bash, on the other hand,
everything is a string, and that leads to several safety issues…</p>

<div><pre><code><span>total_lines</span> <span>=</span> <span>`wc -l my_file`</span><span>.</span><span>to_i</span> <span># an int containing the number of lines of a file</span>
<span>half</span> <span>=</span> <span>total_lines</span><span>.</span><span>div</span> <span>2</span>           <span># integer division</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>`head -n </span><span>#{</span><span>half</span><span>}</span><span> my_file`</span>     <span># print half of the file</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="feature-4-functional-constructions">Feature 4: functional constructions</h2>

<p>Ruby implements <code>map</code>, <code>select</code> (filter), <code>reduce</code>, <code>flat_map</code> and other
functional operations as methods. So, you can, for example, apply a <code>map</code> over a
command output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>puts</span> <span>`ls`</span><span>.</span><span>lines</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>name</span><span>|</span> <span>name</span><span>.</span><span>strip</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>}</span> <span># prints the lengths of the filenames</span>
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note for Git lovers: I know that I could do that only using <code>git branch
--show-current</code>, but that was the first example that came in my mind to
demonstrate the use of regex…</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="feature-5-regex-matching">Feature 5: regex matching</h2>

<p>Regex is a type in Ruby, and operations using regex are built-in in the
language. Look at this example, where we get the current git branch name calling
<code>git branch</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>current_branch_regex</span> <span>=</span> <span>/^\* (\S+)/</span>
<span>output_lines</span> <span>=</span> <span>`git branch`</span><span>.</span><span>lines</span>
<span>output_lines</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>line</span><span>|</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>line</span> <span>=~</span> <span>current_branch_regex</span> <span># match the string with the regex</span>
    <span>puts</span> <span>$1</span>                       <span># prints the match of the first group  </span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="feature-6-easy-threads">Feature 6: easy threads</h2>

<p>If want to work with multiple threads, Ruby is perhaps the one of the easiest
language to do it. Look:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>thread</span> <span>=</span> <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>"I'm in a thread!"</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"I'm outside a thread!"</span>

<span>thread</span><span>.</span><span>join</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, it can be useful for, for example, downloading several files at the same time:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>10</span><span>).</span><span>map</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>                       <span># iterates from i=1 to i=10, inclusive</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>`wget http://my_site.com/file_</span><span>#{</span><span>i</span><span>}</span><span>`</span>  <span># you can use variables inside commands!  </span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>thread</span><span>|</span> <span>thread</span><span>.</span><span>join</span> <span>}</span>        <span># do/end and curly braces have the same purpose!</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="feature-7-builtin-file-and-dir-operations">Feature 7: builtin file and dir operations</h2>

<p>In Ruby, all the file operations are methods of the <code>File</code> class and all the
directory operations are methods of the <code>Dir</code> class, as it should be. In Python,
for example, if you want to read a file you use <code>open</code>, but if you want to
delete it you need to use <code>os.remove</code>, and <code>os</code> does a lot of other things that are
not related to files.</p>

<p>So, in Ruby:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>exists</span> <span>=</span> <span>File</span><span>.</span><span>exists?</span> <span>'My File'</span>           <span># methods that return booleans end in ?</span>
<span>file_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>File</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'My File'</span><span>).</span><span>read</span>
<span>File</span><span>.</span><span>delete</span> <span>'My File'</span>                     <span># parentheses are optional if it's not ambiguous</span>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope that after reading this short text you consider using Ruby as a
replacement for complex shell scripts. I mean, I don’t expect that you drop
Bash entirely, but consider using Ruby when things get complex. Of course, you
can do that in Python, Perl, even JS, but, as my personal choice I think that
Ruby is the most complete and easier Bash replacement for that!</p>

<p>UW researchers found that ChatGPT consistently ranked resumes with disability-related honors and credentials — such as the “Tom Wilson Disability Leadership Award” — lower than the same resumes without those honors and credentials. But when researchers customized the tool with written instructions directing it not to be ableist, the tool reduced this bias for all but one of the disabilities tested.<span>Solen Feyissa/Unsplash</span></p>

<p>While seeking research internships last year, University of Washington graduate student Kate Glazko noticed recruiters posting online that they’d used OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence tools to summarize resumes and rank candidates. Automated screening has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204624204577178941034941330">been commonplace in hiring for decades</a>. Yet <a href="https://kateglazko.com/">Glazko</a>, a doctoral student in the UW’s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, studies <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/detecting-and-mitigating-bias-in-natural-language-processing/">how generative AI can replicate and amplify real-world biases</a> — such as those <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2023/11/02/ai-accessibility-chatgpt-midjourney-ableist/">against disabled people</a>. How might such a system, she wondered, rank resumes that implied someone had a disability?</p>
<p>In a new study, UW researchers found that ChatGPT consistently ranked resumes with disability-related honors and credentials — such as the “Tom Wilson Disability Leadership Award” — lower than the same resumes without those honors and credentials. When asked to explain the rankings, the system spat out biased perceptions of disabled people. For instance, it claimed a resume with an autism leadership award had “less emphasis on leadership roles” — implying the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90706149/neurodivergent-people-make-great-leaders-not-just-employees">stereotype that autistic people aren’t good leaders</a>.</p>
<p>But when researchers customized the tool with written instructions directing it not to be ableist, the tool reduced this bias for all but one of the disabilities tested. Five of the six implied disabilities — deafness, blindness, cerebral palsy, autism and the general term “disability” — improved, but only three ranked higher than resumes that didn’t mention disability.</p>
<p>The team presented <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3630106.3658933">its findings</a> June 5 at the 2024 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>“Ranking resumes with AI is starting to proliferate, yet there’s not much research behind whether it’s safe and effective,” said Glazko, the study’s lead author. “For a disabled job seeker, there’s always this question when you submit a resume of whether you should include disability credentials. I think disabled people consider that even when humans are the reviewers.”</p>
<p>Researchers used one of the study’s authors’ publicly available curriculum vitae (CV), which ran about 10 pages. The team then created six enhanced CVs, each implying a different disability by including four disability-related credentials: a scholarship; an award; a diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) panel seat; and membership in a student organization.</p>
<p>Researchers then used ChatGPT’s GPT-4 model to rank these enhanced CVs against the original version for a real “student researcher” job listing at a large, U.S.-based software company. They ran each comparison 10 times; in 60 trials, the system ranked the enhanced CVs, which were identical except for the implied disability, first only one quarter of the time.</p>
<p>“In a fair world, the enhanced resume should be ranked first every time,” said senior author <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/jmankoff?_gl=1*fyd601*_ga*MzY0OTIyMDM4LjE2OTIzNzc0NDg.*_ga_3T65WK0BM8*MTcxODE0NDkwNC42NTAuMS4xNzE4MTQ0OTQwLjAuMC4w*_ga_JLHM9WH4JV*MTcxODE0NDkwNC42NTAuMS4xNzE4MTQ0OTQwLjAuMC4w">Jennifer Mankoff</a>, a UW professor in the Allen School. “I can’t think of a job where somebody who’s been recognized for their leadership skills, for example, shouldn’t be ranked ahead of someone with the same background who hasn’t.”</p>
<p>When researchers asked GPT-4 to explain the rankings, its responses exhibited explicit and implicit <a href="https://www.washington.edu/doit/what-ableism">ableism</a>. For instance, it noted that a candidate with depression had “additional focus on DEI and personal challenges,” which “detract from the core technical and research-oriented aspects of the role.”</p>
<p>“Some of GPT’s descriptions would color a person’s entire resume based on their disability and claimed that involvement with DEI or disability is potentially taking away from other parts of the resume,” Glazko said. “For instance, it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">hallucinated</a> the concept of ‘challenges’ into the depression resume comparison, even though ‘challenges’ weren’t mentioned at all. So you could see some stereotypes emerge.”</p>
<p>Given this, researchers were interested in whether the system could be trained to be less biased. They turned to the GPTs Editor tool, which allowed them to customize GPT-4 with written instructions (no code required). They instructed this chatbot to not exhibit ableist biases and instead work with <a href="https://disabilityphilanthropy.org/resource/what-is-disability-justice/">disability justice</a> and DEI principles.</p>
<p>They ran the experiment again, this time using the newly trained chatbot. Overall, this system ranked the enhanced CVs higher than the control CV 37 times out of 60. However, for some disabilities, the improvements were minimal or absent: The autism CV ranked first only three out of 10 times, and the depression CV only twice (unchanged from the original GPT-4 results).</p>
<p>“People need to be aware of the system’s biases when using AI for these real-world tasks,” Glazko said. “Otherwise, a recruiter using ChatGPT can’t make these corrections, or be aware that, even with instructions, bias can persist.”</p>
<p>Researchers note that some organizations, such as <a href="http://ourability.com/">ourability.com</a> and <a href="http://inclusively.com/">inclusively.com</a>, are working to improve outcomes for disabled job seekers, who face biases whether or not AI is used for hiring. They also emphasize that more research is needed to document and remedy AI biases. Those include testing other systems, such as Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Llama; including other disabilities; studying the intersections of the system’s bias against disabilities with other attributes such as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-08/openai-s-gpt-shows-bias-in-resume-screening-experiment-big-take">gender and race</a>; exploring whether further customization could reduce biases more consistently across disabilities; and seeing whether the base version of GPT-4 can be made less biased.</p>
<p>“It is so important that we study and document these biases,” Mankoff said. “We’ve learned a lot from and will hopefully contribute back to a larger conversation — not only regarding disability, but also other minoritized identities — around making sure technology is implemented and deployed in ways that are equitable and fair.”</p>
